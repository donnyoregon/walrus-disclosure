-While Walrus operations happen off Sui, they might interact with the blockchain flows defining the
-resource life cycle.
+Walrus operations primarily occur off-chain on storage nodes, though they interact with the [Sui blockchain](https://docs.sui.io/) for [resource lifecycle management](/design/operations-sui.mdx). This page describes the complete off-chain operations for writing, reading, and managing blobs.
 
-## Write Paths
+## Write operations
 
 ![Write paths of Walrus](./images/WriteFlow.png)
 
-Systems overview of writes, illustrated in the previous image:
+### Acquire storage resource
 
-- A user acquires a storage resource of appropriate size and duration on chain, either by directly
-  buying it on the Walrus system object or a secondary market. A user can split, merge, and
-  transfer owned storage resources.
+You acquire a storage resource of appropriate size and duration on-chain, either by directly buying it from the Walrus system object or a secondary market. You can split, merge, and transfer owned storage resources.
 
-- When users want to store a blob, they first erasure code it and compute the
-  blob ID. Then they can perform the following steps themselves, or use a publisher to perform steps
-  on their behalf.
+### Encode and compute blob ID
 
-- The user goes on chain (Sui) and updates a storage resource to register the blob ID with the
-  desired size and lifetime. This emits an event, received by storage nodes. After the
-  user receives they then continue the upload.
+When you want to store a blob, you first apply erasure coding to the blob, and then compute the blob ID from the encoded data. You can then perform the remaining write flow steps yourself, or use a publisher to perform the steps on your behalf.
 
-- The user sends the blob metadata to all storage nodes and each of the blob slivers to the storage
-  node that currently manages the corresponding shard.
+### Register blob ID
 
-- A storage node managing a shard receives a sliver and checks it against the blob ID.
-  It also checks that there is a blob resource with the blob ID that is authorized to store
-  a blob. If correct, the storage node then signs a statement that it holds the sliver for blob ID
-  (and metadata) and returns it to the user.
+Interact with Sui to update a storage resource and register the blob ID with the desired size and lifetime. This emits an event that the Walrus storage nodes receive. The upload continues after event confirmation.
 
-- The user puts together the signatures returned from storage nodes into an availability certificate
-  and submits it to the chain. When the certificate is verified on chain, an availability event for
-  the blob ID is emitted, and all other storage nodes seek to download any missing shards for the
-  blob ID. This event emitted by Sui is the [point of availability (PoA)](/design/properties.mdx) for the
-  blob ID.
+### Store slivers
 
-- After the PoA, and without user involvement, storage nodes sync and recover any missing metadata
-  and slivers.
+Send the blob metadata to all storage nodes. Each of the blob slivers are sent to the storage node that currently manages the corresponding shard.
 
-The user waits for 2/3 of shard signatures to return to create the certificate of
-availability. The rate of the code is below 1/3, allowing for reconstruction even if only 1/3 of
-shards return the sliver for a read. Because at most 1/3 of the storage nodes can fail, this ensures
-reconstruction if a reader requests slivers from all storage nodes. The full process can
-be mediated by a publisher that receives a blob and drives the process to completion.
+### Availability certificate
 
-## Refresh Availability
+A storage node managing a shard receives a sliver and checks it against the blob ID. It also checks that there is a blob resource with the blob ID that is authorized to store a blob. If correct, the storage node then signs a statement that it holds the sliver and returns it to you. Then, you can put together the signatures returned from storage nodes into an availability certificate.
 
-Because no content data is required to refresh the duration of storage, refresh is conducted fully
-on chain within the protocol. To request an extension to the availability of a blob, a user provides
-an appropriate storage resource. Upon success this emits an event that storage nodes receive to
-extend the time for which each sliver is stored.
+### Certify blob ID
 
-## Inconsistent Resource Flow
+Submit an availability certificate to the chain. When the certificate is verified on-chain, an availability event for the blob ID is emitted, and all other storage nodes seek to download any missing shards for the blob ID. This event emitted by Sui is the [point of availability (PoA)](/design/properties.mdx) for the blob ID.
 
-When a correct storage node tries to reconstruct a sliver for a blob past [PoA](/design/properties.mdx),
-this may fail if the encoding of the blob was incorrect. In this case, the storage node can instead
-extract an inconsistency proof for the blob ID. It then uses the proof to create an inconsistency
-certificate and upload it on chain.
+After the PoA, and without your involvement, storage nodes sync and recover any missing metadata and slivers.
 
-The flow is as follows:
+### Effects certificate proves availability
+
+The certificate of availability is created from 2/3 of the returned shard signatures. The erasure code rate is below 1/3, meaning that reconstruction is allowed even if only 1/3 of shards return the sliver for a read. [Because at most 1/3 of the storage nodes can fail](/design/architecture.mdx#byzantine-fault-tolerance), this ensures reconstruction if you request slivers from all storage nodes. A publisher can mediate the full process by receiving a blob and driving the process to completion.
 
-- A storage node fails to reconstruct a sliver, and instead computes an inconsistency proof.
+## Read operations
 
-- The storage node sends the blob ID and inconsistency proof to all storage nodes of the Walrus
-  epoch. The storage nodes verify the proof and sign it.
+Reading blobs from Walrus can occur directly or through aggregators and caches. The operations are identical whether performed by end users, aggregators, or caches experiencing cache misses. In practice, most reads occur through caches for frequently accessed (hot) blobs and do not require requests to storage nodes.
 
-- The storage node who found the inconsistency aggregates the signatures into an inconsistency
-  certificate and sends it to the Walrus smart contract, which verifies it and emits an inconsistent
-  resource event.
+The read flow consists of the following steps:
+1. Obtain the metadata for the blob ID from any storage node and authenticate it using the blob ID.
+2. Send a request to the storage nodes for the shards corresponding to the blob ID and wait for \(f+1\) responses. Send sufficient requests in parallel to ensure low latency for reads.
+3. Authenticate the slivers returned with the blob ID, reconstruct the blob, and decide whether the contents are valid or inconsistent.
+4. Optionally, the result is cached and can be served without reconstruction until it is evicted from the cache. Requests to the cache for the blob return the blob contents or an inconsistency proof.
 
-- Upon receiving an inconsistent resource event, correct storage nodes delete sliver data for the
-  blob ID and record in the metadata to return `None` for the blob ID for the
-  [availability period](/design/properties.mdx). No storage attestation challenges are issued for this
-  blob ID.
+## Refresh availability
 
-:::tip Reading inconsistent blobs
-A blob ID that is inconsistent always resolves to `None` upon reading because
-the read process re-encodes the received blob to check that the blob ID is correctly derived from a
-consistent encoding. This means that an inconsistency proof reveals only a true fact to storage
-nodes (that do not otherwise run decoding), and does not change the output of read in any case.
+Because no blob content is involved, refresh operations are conducted entirely through the Sui protocol. To extend blob availability, provide an appropriate on-chain storage resource. Upon success, storage nodes receive an emitted event to extend the storage duration for each sliver.
 
-However, partial reads leveraging the systematic nature of the encoding might successfully return
-partial reads for inconsistently encoded files. Thus, if consistency and availability of reads is
-important, dApps should do full reads rather than partial reads.
-:::
+## Inconsistency handling
 
-## Read Paths
+After the PoA, a correct storage node attempting to reconstruct a sliver might fail if blob encoding was incorrect. In this case, the node can extract an inconsistency proof for the blob ID. It then uses the proof to create an inconsistency certificate and uploads it on-chain.
 
-A user can read stored blobs either directly or through an aggregator/cache. The operations are the
-same for direct user access, for aggregators, and caches in case of cache misses. In practice, most
-reads happen through caches for blobs that are hot and do not result in requests to storage nodes.
+The flow is as follows:
+1. A storage node fails to reconstruct a sliver, and instead computes an inconsistency proof.
+2. The storage node sends the blob ID and inconsistency proof to all storage nodes of the Walrus epoch. The storage nodes verify the proof and sign it.
+3. The storage node that found the inconsistency aggregates the signatures into an inconsistency certificate and sends it to the [Sui smart contract]((https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/sui-101/move-package-management)), which verifies it and emits an inconsistent resource event.
+4. Upon receiving an inconsistent resource event, correct storage nodes delete sliver data for the blob ID and record in the metadata to return `None` for the blob during the [availability period](/design/properties.mdx). No storage attestation challenges are issued for this blob ID.
 
-- The reader gets the metadata for the blob ID from any storage node, and authenticates it using
-  the blob ID.
+### Reading inconsistent blobs
 
-- The reader then sends a request to the storage nodes for the shards corresponding to the blob ID
-  and waits for \(f+1\) to respond. Sufficient requests are sent in parallel to ensure low latency
-  for reads.
+A blob ID marked as inconsistent always resolves to `None` upon reading. This occurs because the read process re-encodes the received blob to verify that the blob ID was derived from consistent encoding.
 
-- The reader authenticates the slivers returned with the blob ID, reconstructs the blob, and decides
-  whether the contents are a valid blob or inconsistent.
+An inconsistency proof reveals only a true fact to storage nodes (which do not otherwise run decoding) and does not change read output in any case.
 
-- Optionally, for a cache, the result is cached and can be served without reconstruction until it is
-  evicted from the cache. Requests for the blob to the cache return the blob contents, or a proof
-  that the blob is inconsistently encoded.
+However, partial reads leveraging the systematic nature of the encoding might successfully return partial data for inconsistently encoded files. If consistency and availability of reads is important, perform full reads rather than partial reads.

-## Storage Resource Life Cycle on Sui
+## Sui smart contracts
 
 A number of Sui smart contracts hold the metadata of the Walrus system and all its entities.
 
-- A **Walrus system object** holds the committee of storage nodes for the current storage epoch. The
-  system object also holds the total available space on Walrus and the price per unit of storage (1
-  KiB).
-
-  These values are determined by 2/3 agreement between the storage nodes for the storage
-  epoch. Users can pay to purchase storage space for some time duration. These space resources can
-  be split, merged, and transferred. Later, they can be used to place a blob ID into Walrus.
-
-- The **storage fund** holds funds for storing blobs over one or multiple storage epochs. When
-  purchasing storage space from the system object, users pay into the storage fund separated over
-  multiple storage epochs. Payments are made each epoch to storage nodes according to performance
-  (details follow).
-
-- A user acquires some storage through the contracts or transfer and can assign to it a blob ID,
-  signifying they want to store this blob ID into it. This emits a Move **resource event** that
-  storage nodes listen for to expect and authorize off-chain storage operations.
-
-- Eventually a user holds an off-chain **availability certificate** from storage nodes for a blob
-  ID. The user **uploads the certificate on chain** to signal that the blob ID is available for an
-  availability period. The certificate is checked against the latest Walrus committee,
-  and an **availability event** is emitted for the blob ID if correct. This is the point of
-  availability for the blob.
-
-- At a later time, a certified blob's storage can be **extended** by adding a storage object to it
-  with a longer expiry period. This facility can be used by smart contracts to extend the
-  availability of blobs stored in perpetuity as long as funds exist to continue providing storage.
-
-- In case a blob ID is not correctly encoded, an **inconsistency proof certificate** can be uploaded
-  on chain at a later time. This action emits an **inconsistent blob event**, signaling that the
-  blob ID read results always return `None`. This indicates that its slivers can be deleted by
-  storage nodes, except for an indicator to return `None`.
-
-Users writing to Walrus, need to perform Sui transactions to acquire storage and certify blobs.
-Users creating or consuming proofs for attestations of blob availability read the chain
-only to prove or verify emission of events. Nodes read
-the blockchain to get committee metadata only once per epoch, and then request slivers directly
-from storage nodes by blob ID to perform reads on Walrus resources.
-
-## Governance Operations on Sui
-
-Each Walrus storage epoch is represented by the Walrus system object that contains a storage
-committee and various metadata or storage nodes, like the mapping between shards and storage nodes,
-available space, and current costs.
-
-Users can go to the system object for the period and **buy some storage** amount for one or more
-storage epochs. At each storage epoch there is a price for storage, and the payment provided becomes
-part of a **storage fund** for all the storage epochs that span the storage bought. There is a
-maximum number of storage epochs in the future for which storage can be bought (approximately 2
-years). Storage is a resource that can be split, merged, and transferred.
-
-At the end of the storage epoch, part of the funds in the **storage fund need to be allocated to
-storage nodes**. The idea here is for storage nodes to perform light audits of each other,
-and suggest which nodes are to be paid based on the performance of these audits.
+### Walrus system object
+
+Each Walrus storage epoch is represented by the [Walrus system object](https://walruscan.com/testnet/operators) that contains a storage committee and various metadata or storage nodes, including the mapping between shards and storage nodes, available space, and current costs. The system object also holds the total available space on Walrus, and the price per unit of storage. 
+
+These values are determined by 2/3 agreement between storage nodes for each storage epoch. You can pay to purchase storage space for specified durations. These space resources can be split, merged, and transferred. Later, you can use them to place a blob ID into Walrus.
+
+### Storage fund
+
+The **storage fund** holds funds for storing blobs over one or multiple storage epochs. You pay into the storage fund when purchasing storage space from the system object, and payments are separated and allocated across multiple storage epochs. 
+
+At the end of each epoch, funds are distributed to storage nodes based on performance. Storage nodes perform light audits of each other and suggest which nodes should be paid based on audit results.
+
+## Storage resource lifecycle
+
+Storage resources on Walrus have a defined lifecycle on Sui, from acquisition through certification to expiration.
+
+### Acquiring storage
+
+Purchase storage space from the system object by paying into the storage fund for a specified duration (one or more storage epochs). You can split, merge, or transfer storage, and the maximum number of storage epochs that you can purchase is approximately 2 years in advance.
+
+### Assigning a blob ID
+
+Once you acquire some storage, you can assign a blob ID to indicate intent to store. This emits a Move **resource event**, signaling to storage nodes that they should expect and authorize off-chain storage operations.
+
+### Certifying availability
+
+After uploading blob data off-chain, availability is certified on Sui:
+1. Upload blob slivers to storage nodes off-chain.
+2. Storage nodes provide an **availability certificate**.
+3. Upload the certificate on-chain.
+4. System checks certificate against the current Walrus committee.
+5. If valid, system emits an **availability event** for the blob ID.
+
+The availability event marks the [point of availability](/design/properties.mdx) for the blob, after which Walrus guarantees its availability for the specified duration.
+
+### Extending storage
+
+At a later time, you can extend a certified blob's storage by adding a storage object to it with a longer expiry period. Smart contracts can use this mechanism to extend the availability of blobs stored in perpetuity, as long as funds exist to continue providing storage.
+
+### Handling inconsistent blobs
+
+In case a blob ID is not correctly encoded, an [**inconsistency proof certificate**](/design/encoding.mdx) can be uploaded on-chain at a later time. This action emits an **inconsistent blob event** signaling that the blob ID read results always return `None`. This indicates that storage nodes can delete its slivers, except for an indicator to return `None`.
+
+### Interacting with Walrus
+
+When writing to Walrus, you need to perform Sui transactions to acquire storage and certify blobs. When creating or consuming proofs for attestations of blob availability, you read the chain only to prove or verify emission of events. Nodes read the blockchain to get committee metadata only once per epoch, and then request slivers directly from storage nodes by blob ID to perform reads on Walrus resources.

-In addition to the CLI and JSON modes, the Walrus client offers a *daemon mode*. In this mode, it
-runs a simple web server offering HTTP interfaces to store and read blobs in an *aggregator* and
-*publisher* role respectively. We also offer
-[public aggregator and publisher services](#public-services) to try the Walrus HTTP APIs without
-the need to run a local client. See how to
-[operate an aggregator or publisher](/operator-guide/aggregator.mdx) in the operator documentation.
+The Walrus client offers a daemon mode that runs a simple web server that provides HTTP interfaces you can use to store and read blobs in an [aggregator](/operator-guide/aggregator.mdx) or [publisher](/operator-guide/aggregator.mdx) role respectively. Walrus also offers HTTP APIs through [public aggregator and publisher services](#public-services) that you can use without running a local client. 
 
-## HTTP API Usage
-
-For the following examples, we assume you set the `AGGREGATOR` and `PUBLISHER` environment variables
-to your desired aggregator and publisher, respectively. For example, the instances run by Mysten
-Labs on Walrus Testnet (see [below](#public-services) for further public options):

-:::tip API specification
-
-Walrus aggregators and publishers expose their API specifications at the path `/v1/api`. You can
-view this in the browser, for example, at https://aggregator.walrus-testnet.walrus.space/v1/api. The latest version of these specifications are also available [on GitHub](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/tree/main/crates/walrus-service)

-- **Canonical host policy**
-  Choose one hostname type per site (custom domain > SuiNS > base36 is a good priority).
-  All other hosts should include canonical hints pointing to that choice.
-
-- **Base36 subdomains**
-
-  - Disable if not needed: `B36_DOMAIN_RESOLUTION_SUPPORT=false`.
-  - If enabled, add canonical hints (`<link rel="canonical">` or `Link: rel="canonical"`).

-Configuring the `site-builder` tool is straightforward, but care is required to ensure that
-everything works correctly.
-
-The `site-builder` tool requires a configuration file to know which package to use on Sui, which

-through sensible defaults, so you should not need to touch them. Yet, for completeness, we provide

Most of these are abstracted away through sensible defaults, so you should not need to touch them. Yet, for completeness, this document provides the details for all the configuration options.
 
 ## Minimal configuration
 
-The config file is expected to be in one of the [default
-locations](/usage/setup.mdx#config-custom-path), and it is possible to point elsewhere with the
-`--config` flag. For your first run, it should be sufficient to call the `site-builder` without

+If, for any reason, you didn't add `walrus` to `$PATH`, make sure to configure a pointer to the binary.
 
 ## Additional options
 
-If you want to have more control over the behavior of the site builder, you can customize the
-following variables in the config file:
-
-- `package`: the object ID of the Walrus Sites package on Sui. This must always be specified in the
-  config, and is already appropriately configured in `./sites-config.yaml`.
-- `portal`: the name of the portal through which the site will be viewed; this only affects the
-  output of the CLI, and nothing else (default: `wal.app`). All Walrus Sites are accessible
-  through any portal independent of this setting.
-- `general`: these are general options that can be configured both through the CLI and the config:
-  - `rpc_url`: The URL of the Sui RPC node to use. If not set, the `site-builder` will infer it from
-    the wallet.
-  - `wallet`: Pointer to the Sui wallet to be used. By default, it uses the system-wide wallet (the
-    one from `sui client addresses`).
-  - `walrus_binary`: Pointer to the `walrus` binary. By default, this is expected to be run from
-    `$PATH`.
-  - `walrus_config`: The configuration for the `walrus` client binary, see the [relevant
-    chapter](/usage/setup.mdx).
-  - `gas_budget`: The maximum amount of gas to be spent for transactions (default: 500M MIST).

-## Linking to Resources on the Web
+Assume there is some image that you can browse at `https://gallery.wal.app/walrus_arctic.webp`, and you want to link it from your own Walrus Site. `https://wal.app` is just one of many portals. The same resource is browsable from a local portal (`http://gallery.localhost:8080/walrus_arctic.webp`). Therefore, how can you link the resource in a portal-independent way? This is important for interoperability, availability, and respecting the user's choice of portal.
 
-Linking to a resource on the web (`href="https://some.cdn.example.com/stylesheet.css"`) also works
-as usual.
+This problem is solved by having the portals interpret special links that are normally invalid on the web and redirect to the corresponding Walrus Sites resource in the portal itself.
 
-## Linking to Resources in Other Walrus Sites
+### Using Walrus Site links 
 
-Here is the part that is a bit different. Assume there is some image that you can browse at
-`https://gallery.wal.app/walrus_arctic.webp`, and you want to link it from your own Walrus Site.
+Consider the example above, where the resource `/walrus_arctic.webp` is browsed from the Walrus Site with SuiNS name `gallery`, which points to the object ID `abcd123…` (in Base36 encoding). Then, the portal-independent link is: `https://gallery.suiobj/walrus_arctic.webp`. To fix the object ID instead of the SuiNS name, you can use `https://abcd123….suiobj/walrus_arctic.webp`.
 
-Recall that, however, `https://wal.app` is just one of the possibly many portals. I.e., the same
-resource is browsable from a local portal (`http://gallery.localhost:8080/walrus_arctic.webp`).
-Therefore, how can you link the resource in a *portal-independent way*? This is important for

+Another possibility is to directly point to the Walrus blob ID of the resource, and have the browser "sniff" the content type. This works for images, for example, but not for script or stylesheets.

 ## Walrus Site portals
 
-### Portal types
+There are 2 types of portals provided to browse Walrus Sites:
 
-As mentioned before, we provide two types of portals to browse Walrus Sites:
+- The server-side portal, which is a server that resolves a Walrus Site, returning it to the browser. The server-side portal is hosted at https://wal.app. This portal only supports sites that are associated with a SuiNS name.
 
-- The server-side portal, which is a server that resolves a Walrus Site, returning it to the

-- The service-worker portal, which is a service worker that is installed in the browser and
-  resolves a Walrus Site. The service-worker portal is no longer hosted at a specific domain, but
-  the code is still maintained so that it can be used by anyone.

+### The end-to-end resolution of a Walrus Site
 
 The steps below all reference the following figure:
 
 ![Walrus Site resolution](./images/walrus-sites-portal-diagram-with-quilts.svg)
 
-- **Site publishing** (step 0): The site developer publishes the Walrus Site using the
-  [`site-builder`](#the-site-builder), or making use of a publisher. Assume the developer uses the
-  SuiNS name `dapp.sui` to point to the object ID of the created Walrus Site.
-- **Browsing starts** (step 1): A client browses `dapp.wal.app/index.html` in their browser.
-- **Site resolution** (steps 2-6): The portal interprets its *origin* `dapp.wal.app`, and makes
-  a SuiNS resolution for `dapp.sui`, obtaining the related object ID. Using the object ID, it then
-  fetches the dynamic fields of the object (also checking [redirects](/walrus-sites/portal.mdx)). From the
-  dynamic fields, it selects the one for `/index.html`, and extracts its Walrus blob ID and headers
-  (see the [advanced section on headers](/walrus-sites/routing.mdx)).
-- **Blob fetch** (steps 7-11): Given the blob ID, the portal queries a Walrus aggregator for the
-  blob data.
-- **Returning the response** (steps 12-13): Now that the portal has the bytes for `/index.html`, and
-  its headers, it can craft a response that is then rendered by the
-  browser.
-
-These steps are executed for all resources the browser may query thereafter (for example, if
-`/index.html` points to `assets/cat.png`).
-
-## The Site Builder
-
-To facilitate the creation of Walrus Sites, we provide the "site builder" tool. The site builder
-takes care of creating Walrus Sites object on Sui, with the correct structure, and stores the site
-resources to Walrus. Refer to the [tutorial](/walrus-sites/tutorial.mdx) for setup and usage instructions.

+Walrus is a decentralized storage protocol designed specifically to enable data markets for the AI era and make data reliable, valuable, and governable. Walrus focuses on providing a robust but affordable solution for storing unstructured content on decentralized storage nodes while ensuring high availability and reliability even in the presence of Byzantine faults.
 
 ## Features
 
-- **Storage and retrieval:** Walrus supports storage operations to write and read blobs. It also
-  allows anyone to prove that a blob has been stored and is available for retrieval at a later
-  time.
-
-- **Cost efficiency:** By utilizing advanced erasure coding, Walrus maintains storage costs at
-  approximately five times the size of the stored blobs, and encoded parts of each blob are stored
-  on each storage node. This is significantly more cost-effective than traditional full-replication
-  methods and much more robust against failures than protocols that only store each blob on a subset
-  of storage nodes.
-
-- **Integration with the Sui blockchain:** Walrus leverages [Sui](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui)
-  for coordination, attesting availability, and payments. Storage space is represented as a resource
-  on Sui, which can be owned, split, merged, and transferred. Stored blobs are also represented by
-  objects on Sui, which means that smart contracts can check whether a blob is available and for how
-  long, extend its lifetime or optionally delete it.
+- **Storage and retrieval:** Walrus supports storage operations to write and read blobs. It also allows anyone to prove that a blob has been stored and is available for retrieval at a later time.
 
-- **Epochs, tokenomics, and delegated proof of stake** Walrus is operated by a committee of storage
-  nodes that evolve between epochs. A native token, WAL (and its subdivision FROST, where 1 WAL is
-  equal to 1 billion FROST), is used to delegate stake to storage nodes, and those with high stake
-  become part of the epoch committee. The WAL token is also used for payments for storage. At the
-  end of each epoch, rewards for selecting storage nodes, storing and serving blobs are distributed
-  to storage nodes and whose that stake with them. All these processes are mediated by smart
-  contracts on the Sui platform.

-- **Flexible access:** Users can interact with Walrus through a command-line interface (CLI),
-  software development kits (SDKs), and web2 HTTP technologies. Walrus is designed to work well
-  with traditional caches and content distribution networks (CDNs), while ensuring all operations
-  can also be run using local tools to maximize decentralization.

-**All blobs stored in Walrus are public and discoverable by all.** Therefore you must not use Walrus

-confidentiality. Refer to [Data Security](/docs/dev-guide/data-security) for such use cases.

 ## Architecture and operations
 
-Walrus's architecture ensures that content remains accessible and retrievable even when many
-storage nodes are unavailable or malicious. Under the hood it uses modern error correction
-techniques based on fast linear fountain codes, augmented to ensure resilience against Byzantine
-faults, and a dynamically changing set of storage nodes. The core of Walrus remains simple, and
-storage node management and blob certification leverages Sui smart contracts.

-## Organization
-
-This documentation is split into several parts:
-
-1. _Docs_ provides concrete information on Walrus for developers. If you want to get started quickly, you can
-   jump directly to [Getting Started with Walrus](/docs/usage/started).
-1. _Walrus Sites_ describes how you can use Walrus and Sui together to build truly decentralized
-   websites.
-1. _Design_ describes the objectives, security properties, and architecture of Walrus.
-1. _Dev blog_ contains announcements and other blog posts.

+title: Tusky Migration Guide
+description: During the Tusky sunsetting period, you can continue reading your data and migrate to using Walrus directly or through alternative tooling.
+keywords: [ tusky, migration, migrate from tusky, tusky sunset, data migration ] 
+---
+
+As of December 19, 2025, the storage service Tusky is shutting down. Data stored on Walrus through Tusky is still safe and accessible. During Tusky's sunsetting period, you can continue reading your data, however you must either migrate to using Walrus directly or through alternative tooling.
+
+During this sunset period, you must:
+
+1. Take note of the Tusky sunsetting window.
+
+2. Request your encryption keys from Tusky if you use the password protected keys stored by them.
+
+3. Begin downloading your datasets. [Refer to the Tusky documentation for more information](https://docs.tusky.io/tusky-shutdown/tusky-shutting-down-how-to-retrieve-your-data) or view the [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cur04QKUCA).
+
+4. Decide which migration option fits your use case best.
+
+5. Complete re-upload where required.
+
+6. Validate reads and access patterns on Walrus.
+
+7. Update applications or workflows as needed.
+
+## Immediate first steps 
+
+1. Take note of the sunset window.
+   - You have at least **30 days** (until January 19, 2025) of guaranteed read access via Tusky from the date of their shut down announcement.
+   - **Do not wait until the last week of this 30 day window**.
+2. Take inventory of your data. Having an inventory of your data will help determine which migration option fits best.
+   - Make a list of:
+     - [Vaults and buckets](https://docs.tusky.io/http-api#tag/vaults/get/vaults)
+     - [Blob IDs or file paths](https://docs.tusky.io/http-api#tag/blobs/get/blobs)
+     - Encryption keys
+   - Estimate the approximate total size of your data.
+
+3. Request your encryption keys from Tusky now if you use the [password protected keys they store](https://github.com/tusky-io/ts-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#encryption).
+
+## Important note on encryption (applies to all migration options)
+
+Tusky supports self-hosted keys and keys supplied by the user but [stored on Tusky and password protected](https://github.com/tusky-io/ts-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#encryption). They implement server-side encryption and decryption of blobs with those keys, which means that a user or app client does not need to do the actual encryption or decryption on their end. 
+
+**This means once you download your data from Tusky, it should already be decrypted.**
+
+Based on your needs for data management going forward, you can choose to encrypt your data using an alternative mechanism as mentioned in the migration options. If you request the Tusky-stored encryption keys from them before they shut down the service, you may choose to reuse those keys with the relevant alternatives.
+
+## Migration option 1: Download from Tusky → decrypt → re-upload to Walrus
+
+1. Download your data from Tusky
+  - Use the Tusky app, HTTP API, or SDK for bulk export. [Refer to the Tusky documentation for more information](https://docs.tusky.io/tusky-shutdown/tusky-shutting-down-how-to-retrieve-your-data) or view the [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cur04QKUCA).
+
+2. Set up a Walrus client
+  - Install Walrus [CLI](/docs/usage/client-cli) or [SDK](/docs/usage/sdks), or use the [web API](/docs/usage/web-api): https://docs.wal.app/docs/usage/started 
+
+3. Re-upload to Walrus
+  - Use the [CLI](/docs/usage/client-cli), [SDK](/docs/usage/sdks), or [web API](/docs/usage/web-api).
+
+  - For encryption, either:
+    - Use a third-party library (like [CryptoES](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-es) or [Node’s Crypto Module](https://medium.com/@tony.infisical/guide-to-nodes-crypto-module-for-encryption-decryption-65c077176980) for symmetric key based encryption before upload. You can optionally use the keys that you might have retrieved from Tusky.
+    - Integrate Seal as part of your write flow. This requires a Move-based access policy and integration with key server providers: https://seal-docs.wal.app/GettingStarted/.
+
+
+## Migration option 2: Direct Walrus access through blob or quilt patch IDs
+
+1. Extract blob or patch IDs and metadata from Tusky (through their app, API, or SDK).
+
+2. Fetch blobs or quilt patches directly from Walrus using:
+  - [Walrus CLI](/docs/usage/client-cli)
+  - [Walrus HTTP API](/docs/usage/web-api)
+  - [Walrus SDKs](/docs/usage/sdks)
+  - [Walrus Quilt](/docs/usage/quilt)
+
+3. Validate integrity and availability of the data.
+  - You might have to decrypt your data using encryption keys that you have retrieved from Tusky. Make sure you request these **before** their service is shut down.
+
+4. Update your application or workflows to reference Walrus directly going forward.
+
+## Migration option 3: Migrate to another Walrus-compatible interface (Managed UX)
+
+Available options:
+
+  - [Nami Cloud](https://docs.nami.cloud/introduction)
+  - [Zark Lab](https://zarklab.ai): Refer to the [Getting Started with Zark guide](./zark.pdf).
+  - [Pawtato](https://pawtato.app/board/walrus/upload)
+
+:::tip
+More managed UX options coming soon.
+:::
+
+1. Export data from Tusky
+  - Use the Tusky app, API, or SDK to download all required data.
+  - Evaluate and choose one of the options listed above.
+  - Based on your needs, confirm support for:
+    - Bulk uploads
+    - Large files
+    - Encryption
+    - Long-term maintenance and support
+
+2. Re-upload data
+  - Upload data through the new interface (relevant UI, API, or SDK).
+  - Re-apply encryption and access controls as needed.
+
+3. Validate access and workflows
+  - Confirm reads, permissions, and any application integrations.

    chore(node): enable DB transactions and garbage collection by default (#2772)
    
    This enables blob-info cleanup and data deletion, which were implemented
    in previous PRs, as well as DB transactions by default.
    
    Also modifies the default batch sizes following test results on PTN,
    Testnet, and Mainnet. The new values correspond to slightly less than
    1s expected processing time per batch.
    
    Finally, adds mechanisms to validate the node config on load; in particular,
    adds a check that DB transactions are enabled if data deletion is enabled.

-The key actors in the Walrus architecture are the following:
-
-- **Users** through **clients** want to store and read **blobs** identified by their **blob ID**.
-
-  These actors are ready to pay for service
-  when it comes to writes and non-best-effort reads. Users also want to prove
-  the **availability** of a blob to third parties without the cost of sending or receiving the full
-  blob.
-
-  Users might be malicious in various ways: they might not want to pay for services, prove the
-  availability of unavailable blobs, modify/delete blobs without authorization, try to
-  exhaust resources of storage nodes, and so on.
-
-- **Storage nodes** hold one or many **shards** within a **storage epoch**.
-
-  Each blob is erasure-encoded into many **slivers**. Slivers from each stored blob become part
-  of all shards. A shard at any storage epoch is associated with a storage node that actually stores
-  all slivers of the shard and is ready to serve them.
-
-  A Sui smart contract controls the assignment of shards to storage nodes within
-  **storage epochs** (2 weeks on Mainnet), and Walrus assumes that more than 2/3 of the
-  shards are managed by correct storage nodes within each storage epoch. This means that Walrus must
-  tolerate up to 1/3 of the shards managed by Byzantine storage nodes (approximately 1/3 of the
-  storage nodes being Byzantine) within each storage epoch and across storage epochs.
-
-- All clients and storage nodes operate a blockchain client (specifically on Sui), and mediate
-  payments, resources (space), mapping of shards to storage nodes, and metadata through blockchain
-  smart contracts. Users interact with the blockchain to acquire storage resources and upload
-  certificates for stored blobs. Storage nodes listen to the blockchain events to coordinate
-  their operations.
-
-Walrus supports any additional number of optional infrastructure actors that can operate in a
-permissionless way:
-
-- **Aggregators** are clients that reconstruct blobs from slivers and make them available to users
-  over traditional web2 technologies (such as HTTP). They are optional in that end users may
-  reconstruct blobs directly or run a local aggregator to perform Walrus reads over web2
-  technologies locally.
-
-- **Caches** are aggregators with additional caching functionality to decrease latency and reduce
-  load on storage nodes. Such cache infrastructures may also act as CDNs, split the cost of blob
-  reconstruction over many requests, be better connected, and so on. A client can always verify that
-  reads from such infrastructures are correct.
-
-- **Publishers** are clients that help end users store a blob using web2 technologies,
-  using less bandwidth and custom logic.
-
-  In effect, they receive the blob to be published over traditional web2 protocols (like HTTP) and
-  run the Walrus store protocol on the end user's behalf. This includes encoding the blob into
-  slivers, distributing the slivers to storage nodes, collecting storage-node signatures and
-  aggregating them into a certificate, as well as all other on-chain actions.
-
-  They are optional in that a user can directly interact with Sui and
-  the storage nodes to store blobs. An end user can always verify that a publisher
-  performed their duties correctly by checking that an event associated with the
-  **[point of availability](/design/properties.mdx)** for the blob exists on chain
-  and then either performing a read to see if Walrus returns the blob or encoding the blob
-  and comparing the result to the blob ID in the certificate.
-
-Aggregators, publishers, and end users are not considered trusted components of the system, and they
-might deviate from the protocol arbitrarily. However, some of the security properties of Walrus only
-hold for honest end users that use honest intermediaries (caches and publishers). Walrus provides a
-means for end users to audit the correct operation of both caches and publishers.
+The Walrus architecture is built on the following key actors:
+
+- **Users:** Clients that store and retrieve data blobs.
+- **Storage nodes:** Distributed storage nodes that hold erasure-coded data.
+- **Blockchain coordination:** [Sui blockchain](https://docs.sui.io/) that manages payments, metadata, and system orchestration.
+
+## Users
+
+**Users** [interact with Walrus](/docs/content/usage/client-cli.mdx) through **clients** to store and read **blobs**, which are identified by their **blob ID**. Users engage with the system in two primary ways:
+
+- **Storage:** Users store new blobs and pay [required costs](/docs/content/dev-guide/costs.mdx) for [write](/docs/content/dev-guide/dev-operations.mdx#store) and [non-best-effort read](/docs/content/dev-guide/dev-operations.mdx#read) operations.
+- **Availability:** Users can [prove a blob's availability to third parties](/docs/content/dev-guide/dev-operations.mdx#certify-availability) without the cost of transmitting the full blob.
+
+Users might also exhibit malicious behavior, including:
+- Refusing to pay for services
+- Attempting to prove availability of unavailable blobs
+- Modifying or deleting blobs without authorization
+- Exhausting storage node resources
+
+## Storage nodes
+
+**Storage nodes** manage the actual data storage on Walrus. Each storage node holds one or more **shards** during a [storage epoch](/docs/blog/04_testnet_update.mdx#epochs). Each blob undergoes [erasure encoding](/docs/content/design/encoding.mdx), which splits it into many **slivers**. These slivers from each stored blob become distributed across all shards in the system. At any given storage epoch, a storage node associates with one or more shards. The node stores all slivers belonging to its assigned shards and serves them upon request.
+
+## Blockchain coordination
+
+All clients and storage nodes run a Sui blockchain client, which provides the coordination layer for the entire system. The Sui network manages several operations, including:
+
+- **Payments:** Processing storage fees and service payments.
+- **Resource management:** Allocating and tracking storage capacity.
+- **Shard assignment:** Mapping shards to storage nodes.
+- **Metadata management:** Storing blob certificates and system state.
+
+Users interact with the Sui network to acquire storage resources and submit certificates for stored blobs. Storage nodes monitor blockchain events to coordinate their operations and respond to system changes.
+
+### Byzantine fault tolerance
+
+A [Sui smart contract](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/sui-101/move-package-management?q=move+package) controls how shards are assigned to storage nodes. These assignments occur within **storage epochs**, which last 2 weeks on Mainnet.
+
+Walrus assumes that more than 2/3 of shards are managed by correct storage nodes within each storage epoch. The system tolerates up to 1/3 of shards being controlled by Byzantine (malicious or faulty) storage nodes. This tolerance level applies both within individual storage epochs and across transitions between epochs.
+
+## Optional infrastructure
+
+Walrus supports any additional number of optional infrastructure actors that can operate in a permissionless way.
+
+### Aggregators 
+
+Aggregators are clients that reconstruct complete blobs from individual slivers and serve them to users over traditional Web2 technologies like HTTP. They are optional because end users can reconstruct blobs directly from storage nodes or run a local aggregator to perform reads over Web2 protocols.
+
+### Caches
+
+Caches are aggregators with additional caching functionality to decrease latency and reduce load on storage nodes. Cache infrastructures can also act as CDNs, split the cost of blob reconstruction over many requests, and provide better network connectivity. A client can always verify that reads from cache infrastructures are correct.
+
+### Publishers
+
+Publishers are clients that help end users store blobs through Web2 technologies while using less bandwidth and offering custom logic. Publishers streamline the storage process by:
+
+1. Receiving the blob over traditional Web2 protocols (like HTTP)
+2. Encoding the blob into slivers
+3. Distributing slivers to storage nodes
+4. Collecting storage node signatures
+5. Aggregating signatures into a certificate
+6. Performing all required on-chain actions
+
+Publishers are optional because users can directly interact with Sui and storage nodes to store blobs. An end user can always verify that a publisher performed their duties correctly by checking that an event associated with the **[point of availability](/design/properties.mdx)** for the blob exists on-chain, and then either performing a read to see if Walrus returns the blob, or encoding the blob and comparing the result to the blob ID in the certificate.

However, some of the security properties of Walrus only hold for honest end users that use honest intermediaries (caches and publishers). Walrus provides a means for end users to audit the correct operation of both caches and publishers.

+Walrus uses a bespoke erasure code construction called RedStuff, based on efficiently computable Reed-Solomon codes. For complete technical details, see the [Walrus whitepaper](/walrus.pdf). This page summarizes some of the basic techniques and terminology used by Walrus.
 
 ## Basics
 
-The following list summarizes the basic encoding and cryptographic techniques used in Walrus:
+Walrus encodes blobs using erasure codes to ensure data can be recovered even when some storage nodes are unavailable or malicious.
 
-- An [erasure code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure_code) encode algorithm takes a blob,
-  splits it into a number \(k\) of symbols, and encodes it into \(n>k\) symbols in such a way that a
-  subset of these \(n\) symbols can be used to reconstruct the blob.
+### Erasure coding
 
-- Walrus uses a highly efficient erasure code and selects \(k\) such that a third of symbols can be
-  used to reconstruct the blob by the decode algorithm.
+An [erasure code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure_code) transforms data by:
 
-- The encoding is *systematic*, meaning that some storage nodes hold part of the original blob,
-  allowing for fast random-access reads.
+1. Taking a blob and splitting it into \(k\) symbols.
+2. Encoding these into \(n\) symbols (where \(n > k\)).
+3. Distributing symbols so any subset can reconstruct the original blob.
 
-- All encoding and decoding operations are deterministic, and encoders have no discretion about it.
+This process allows Walrus encoding to be:
 
-- For each blob, multiple symbols are combined into a **sliver**, which is then assigned to a shard.
+- **Highly efficient:** Walrus can reconstruct a blob from just one-third of the encoded symbols.
+- **Systematic:** Some storage nodes hold part of the original blob, enabling fast random-access reads.
+- **Deterministic:** All encoding and decoding operations follow fixed algorithms with no discretion.
 
-- Storage nodes manage one or more shards, and corresponding slivers of each blob are distributed
-  to all the storage shards.
+For each blob, multiple symbols are combined into a **sliver**, which is then assigned to a shard. Storage nodes manage one or more shards, and the corresponding slivers of each blob are distributed to all storage shards.
 
-The detailed encoding setup results in an expansion of the blob size by a factor of \(4.5 \sim 5\).
-This is independent of the number of shards and the number of storage nodes.
+This detailed encoding setup results in an expansion of the blob size by a factor of 4.5-5. This is independent of the number of shards and the number of storage nodes.
 
-## Metadata and Data Authentication
+## Blob authentication
 
-Each blob is also associated with some metadata including a **blob ID** to allow data authenticity
-verification:
+Each blob has associated metadata, including a **blob ID**, that enables data authenticity verification.
 
-- The blob ID is computed as an authenticator of the set of all shard data and metadata (byte size,
-  encoding, blob hash).
+### Blob ID computation
 
-  Walrus hashes a sliver representation in each of the shards and adds the resulting hashes into a
-  Merkle tree. Then the root of the Merkle tree is the blob hash used to derive the blob ID that
-  identifies the blob in the system.
+The **blob ID** is computed as an authenticator of the set of all shard data and metadata (byte size, encoding, blob hash):
 
-- Each storage node can use the blob ID to check if some shard data belongs to a blob using the
-  authenticated structure corresponding to the blob hash (Merkle tree). A successful check means
-  that the data is indeed as intended by the writer of the blob.
+1. **Sliver hashing:** Walrus computes a hash of the sliver representation in each shard.
+2. **Merkle tree construction:** These hashes form the leaves of a Merkle tree.
+3. **Blob hash derivation:** The Merkle tree root becomes the blob hash.
 
-## Data Integrity and Consistency
+Each storage node can use the blob ID to authenticate shard data by checking it against the corresponding blob hash in the authenticated structure (Merkle tree). A successful check confirms that the data matches what the blob writer intended.
 
-Slivers, metadata, and the blob ID are computed by the client when writing a blob. As clients are
-generally untrusted, any step in this computation can be incorrect, either through a bug or on
-purpose. Concretely, the client can make one or more of the following mistakes:
+## Data integrity and consistency
 
-1. Incorrectly compute slivers.
-1. Incorrectly compute the sliver hashes based on the slivers.
-1. Incorrectly compute the blob ID based on the sliver hashes and other metadata.
+Clients compute slivers, metadata, and blob IDs when writing blobs. Because clients are untrusted, these computations might be incorrect due to bugs or malicious intent. Concretely, a client can make one or more of the following mistakes:
 
-Walrus has several mechanisms to detect each of these:
+- Incorrect sliver computation
+- Incorrect hash computation from the slivers
+- Incorrect blob ID computation from the sliver hashes and other metadata
 
-- Inconsistencies of the last type (incorrect blob-ID computation) are detected immediately by
-  storage nodes when the client attempts to upload metadata. Storage nodes will never issue storage
-  certificates for such blobs, and they are therefore never even certified.
+### Detection mechanisms
 
-- Inconsistencies of the second type (incorrect sliver-hash computation) are generally detected
-  either before or shortly after certification, unless the slivers with incorrect hashes are handled
-  by malicious storage nodes.
+Honest storage nodes that are assigned an incorrect sliver, or one with an incorrect hash, will attempt to recover it from other storage nodes and then notice the inconsistency. They can then extract one symbol per sliver to form an inconsistency proof, which is then used to mark the blob as invalid. After this, storage nodes can delete slivers belonging to inconsistently encoded blobs, and upon request, return either the inconsistency proof or an inconsistency certificate posted on-chain.

-  storage nodes can delete slivers belonging to inconsistently encoded blobs, and upon request
-  return either the inconsistency proof or an inconsistency certificate posted on chain.
+**Incorrect sliver computation:**
+- Can be detected by storage nodes using the process above.
+- Not guaranteed to trigger immediately after certification.
+- May persist in the network for longer periods.
+- Requires additional client-side consistency checks.
 
-- Inconsistencies of the first type can also be detected by storage nodes. The process is the same
-  as in the case above, but it is not guaranteed to be triggered immediately after certification.
+**Incorrect hash computation:**
+- Generally detected before or shortly after certification using the process above.
 
-  As a result, such inconsistencies may persist within the network for longer periods of time,
-  requiring additional client-side checks.
+**Incorrect blob ID computation:**
+- Detected immediately when the client uploads metadata.
+- Storage nodes reject these blobs and never issue storage certificates.
+- Such blobs are never certified.
 
-The following sections describe the different types of consistency checks performed by clients.
+## Consistency checks
 
-```admonish info title="Select the appropriate consistency check"
-In the majority of cases, the default consistency check is sufficient, in particular if the writer
-of the blob is trusted. The strict consistency check is only needed if specific availability
-guarantees are required. If the writer of a blob is known and trusted, it is also possible to
-completely disable the consistency check.
-```
+Clients perform consistency checks when reading blobs to ensure data integrity. Walrus offers two levels of verification: **default** and **strict**.
 
-### Default Consistency Check
+In most cases, the default consistency check is sufficient, particularly when the blob writer is trusted. The strict consistency check is only needed for specific availability guarantees. When the writer is known and trusted, consistency checks can be disabled entirely.
 
-When reading a blob from Walrus, a client first checks the authenticity of the metadata and then
-requests a subset of primary slivers checking their authenticity using the metadata. Using 334
-authentic primary slivers, the original blob data can be decoded.
+### Default consistency check
 
-The encoding used by Walrus has the property that *the first 334 primary slivers contain the
-(potentially padded) unencoded data*. This means that the (cryptographic) hashes of these slivers
-together with the blob length uniquely determine the content of the blob. Therefore, by recomputing
-the sliver hashes of the first 334 slivers and checking them against the metadata, the client can
-verify that the decoded data is correct. If this check succeeds, the data is provided to the user,
-otherwise an error is returned. This check provides the following guarantees:
+The default check balances performance with security by verifying only the read data.
 
-```admonish tip title="Data consistency property"
-Any correct client attempting to read a blob, performing the default consistency check, will either
-read the specific value authenticated by the writer or return an error.
-```
+**Check process:**
 
-### Strict Consistency Check
+1. Client requests blob metadata and verifies its authenticity.
+2. Client requests a subset of primary slivers (334 slivers minimum).
+3. Client verifies sliver authenticity using the metadata.
+4. Client decodes the original blob from these authentic slivers.
 
-If the blob was encoded correctly, any set of 334 primary slivers decode to the same data. However,
-if the writer of a blob encoded the data incorrectly, different sets of slivers may decode to
-different data. Even in that case, there is only one correct value that can be read by an honest
-client (guarantee stated above), but some read attempts may result in a failure while others
-succeed. Furthermore, the blob may be detected as inconsistent by storage nodes at a later point,
-after which all read attempts would fail.
+The first 334 primary slivers contain the unencoded data (potentially padded). This means the cryptographic hashes of these slivers, combined with the blob length, uniquely determine the blob content. Therefore, by recomputing the sliver hashes of the first 334 slivers and checking them against the metadata, the client can verify that the decoded data is correct. If the hashes match, the data is provided to the user, otherwise an error is returned. 
 
-For this reason, Walrus optionally offers a *strict consistency check*: After decoding the blob, the
-client fully *re-encodes* it and recomputes all hashes and the blob ID. Only if that computation
-results in the blob ID they are trying to read is the read considered successful. This check is
-strictly stronger than the default consistency check and therefore also fulfills the data
-consistency property above.
+Any correct client attempting to read a blob and performing the default consistency check, will either read the specific value authenticated by the writer or return an error.
 
-In addition, this process *ensures that the original writer encoded the blob correctly*. Therefore,
-after a blob was read successfully with the strict consistency check enabled, the following property
-holds in addition:
+### Strict consistency check
 
-:: tip Guarantee after strict consistency check succeeded
+The strict check provides stronger guarantees by verifying the entire blob encoding, not just the read portion.
 
-Any correct client attempting to read a blob during its lifetime will always succeed and read the
-same data intended by the writer, irrespective of which consistency check is performed.
+When a blob is encoded incorrectly, different sets of 334 slivers might decode to different data. The default check guarantees correct data when a read succeeds, but some read attempts might fail while others succeed. Storage nodes might later detect the blob as inconsistent, causing all subsequent reads to fail.
 
-:::
+**Check process:**
 
-For quilt patches, only a variant of the default consistency check is available, as only
-part of the quilt is read.
+1. Client decodes the blob (same as default check).
+2. Client fully re-encodes the decoded blob.
+3. Client recomputes all sliver hashes and the blob ID.
+4. Client verifies the computed blob ID matches the requested blob ID.
+5. Read succeeds only if blob IDs match.
+
+This check is more rigorous than the default check and provides the same data consistency property. It ensures the original writer encoded the blob correctly, eliminating the possibility of inconsistent reads across different clients or time periods.
+
+Additionally, the strict check guarantees that any correct client attempting to read the blob during its lifetime will always succeed and read the same data intended by the writer, regardless of which consistency check they perform.
+
+### Consistency checks for quilts
+
+For [quilt patches](/docs/content/usage/quilt.mdx), only a variant of the default consistency check is available, because clients read only part of the quilt rather than the entire structure.

 Under the hood, [storage cost](/dev-guide/costs.mdx) is a small fixed multiple of the size of blobs (around 5x). Advanced erasure coding keeps the cost low, in contrast to the full replication of data traditional to blockchains, such as the >100x multiple for data stored in Sui objects. As a result, storage of large resources (multiple GB) is possible on Walrus at substantially lower cost than on Sui or other blockchains. Because all storage nodes store encoded blobs, Walrus also provides superior robustness compared to designs using a small amount of replicas to store the full blob.
 
-Walrus uses the [Sui chain](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui) for coordination and payments. Available storage is represented as Sui objects that can be acquired, owned, split, merged, and transferred. Storage space can be tied to a stored blob for a period of time, with the resulting Sui object used to prove availability either on-chain in smart contracts, or off-chain using light clients.
-
-Currently, Walrus is compatible with periodic payments for continued storage. It also allows light nodes to get rewards for storing small parts of blobs, proving availability, and assisting recovery. Future plans include implementing some minimal governance to allow storage nodes to change between storage epochs, as well as challenge-based storage attestation for blob storage and availability confidence. These topics will be covered in later documents, and encoding scheme details will also be provided in a separate document.

-The properties below hold true subject to the assumption that for all storage epochs 2/3 of shards
-are operated by storage nodes that faithfully and correctly follow the Walrus protocol.
+The following properties are true for all storage epochs where at least 2/3 of shards are operated by storage nodes that faithfully and correctly follow the Walrus protocol.
 
-As described [before](/design/encoding.mdx), each blob is encoded into slivers using an erasure code and a
-blob ID is cryptographically derived. For a given blob ID there is a **point of availability (PoA)**
-and an **availability period**, observable through an event on the Sui chain.
+## Key concepts
 
-The following properties relate to the PoA:
+Each blob undergoes [erasure encoding](/docs/content/design/encoding.mdx) into slivers, and a blob ID is cryptographically derived from this encoding.
+
+### Point of availability (PoA)
+
+For each stored blob ID, Walrus defines a PoA that marks when the system takes responsibility for maintaining the blob's availability.
 
-- After the PoA, for a blob ID, any correct user that performs a read within the availability period
-  will eventually terminate and get a value \(V\) which is either the blob contents \(F\) or `None`.
-- After the PoA, if two correct users perform a read and get \(V\) and \(V'\), respectively, then
-  \(V = V'\).
-- A correct user with an appropriate storage resource can always perform store for a blob \(F\) with
-  a blob ID and advance the protocol until the PoA.
-- A read after the PoA for a blob \(F\) stored by a correct user, will result in \(F\).
+The **availability period** specifies how long Walrus maintains a blob after its PoA. Both the PoA and availability period are observable through events on Sui.
 
-Some assurance properties ensure the correct internal processes of Walrus storage nodes.
-For the purposes of defining these, an **inconsistency proof** proves that a blob ID was
-stored by a user that incorrectly encoded a blob.
+Before the PoA, the client is responsible for ensuring blob availability and uploading it to Walrus.
 
-- After the PoA and for a blob ID stored by a correct user, a storage node is always able to recover
-  the correct slivers for its shards for this blob ID.
-- After the PoA, if a correct storage node cannot recover a sliver, it can produce an inconsistency
-  proof for the blob ID.
-- If a blob ID is stored by a correct user, an inconsistently proof cannot be derived for it.
-- A read by a correct user for a blob ID for which an inconsistency proof may exist returns `None`.
+After the PoA, Walrus is responsible for maintaining blob availability for the full availability period. The PoA is observable through an event on the Sui chain, and this event attests to the blob's availability in the system.
+
+## Read and write properties
+
+The following properties relate to the PoA:
 
-Note that there is no delete operation and a blob ID past the PoA will be available for the full
-availability period.
+- **Read completion:** After the PoA for a blob ID, any correct user performing a read within the availability period will eventually terminate and receive a value \(V\). This value is either the blob contents \(F\) or `None`.
+- **Read consistency:** After the PoA, if two correct users perform reads and receive values \(V\) and \(V'\) respectively, then \(V = V'\). All correct readers see the same value.
+- **Correct storage guarantee:** A correct user with an appropriate storage resource can always perform a store operation for a blob \(F\) with a blob ID and advance the protocol until the PoA.
+- **Correct blob retrieval:** A read after the PoA for a blob \(F\) stored by a correct user will return \(F\). Correctly stored blobs are always retrievable.
 
-:::tip Rule of thumb
+## Storage node assurance
 
-Before the PoA it is the responsibility of a client to ensure the availability of a blob and its
-upload to Walrus. After the PoA it is the responsibility of Walrus as a system to maintain the
-availability of the blob as part of its operation for the full availability period remaining.
-Emission of the event corresponding to the PoA for a blob ID attests its availability.
+Some assurance properties ensure the correct internal processes of Walrus storage nodes. For the purposes of defining these, an **inconsistency proof** proves that a blob ID was stored by a user that incorrectly encoded a blob:
 
-:::
+- **Sliver recovery:** After the PoA, for a blob ID stored by a correct user, a storage node can always recover the correct slivers for its shards for this blob ID.
+- **Inconsistency detection:** After the PoA, if a correct storage node cannot recover a sliver, it can produce an inconsistency proof for the blob ID.
+- **Encoding protection:** If a blob ID is stored by a correct user, an inconsistency proof cannot be derived for it.
+- **Inconsistent blob handling:** A read by a correct user for a blob ID for which an inconsistency proof might exist returns `None`.

It ensures that content survives storage nodes suffering Byzantine faults, remaining available and retrievable.

+Walrus supports operations to store and read blobs, and to prove and verify their availability. It ensures that content survives storage nodes suffering Byzantine faults, remaining available and retrievable. It provides APIs to access the stored content over CLI, SDKs, and Web2 HTTP technologies, and supports content delivery infrastructures like caches and content distribution networks (CDNs).
 
 Under the hood, [storage cost](/dev-guide/costs.mdx) is a small fixed multiple of the size of blobs (around 5x). Advanced erasure coding keeps the cost low, in contrast to the full replication of data traditional to blockchains, such as the >100x multiple for data stored in Sui objects. As a result, storage of large resources (multiple GB) is possible on Walrus at substantially lower cost than on Sui or other blockchains. Because all storage nodes store encoded blobs, Walrus also provides superior robustness compared to designs using a small amount of replicas to store the full blob.

-1. The `--epochs <EPOCHS>` option indicates the number of epochs the blob should be stored for.

-    to two years. In addition to a positive integer, you can also use `--epochs max` to store the blob
-    for the maximum number of epochs. Note that the end epoch is defined as the current epoch plus the
-    specified number of epochs.
-1. The `--earliest-expiry-time <EARLIEST_EXPIRY_TIME>` option takes a date in RFC3339 format
-    (e.g., "2024-03-20T15:00:00Z") or a more relaxed format (e.g., "2024-03-20 15:00:00") and ensures
-    the blob expires after that date if possible.
-1. The `--end-epoch <END_EPOCH>` option takes a specific end epoch for the blob.
+You can store a single file or multiple files, separated by spaces. Notably, this is compatible with glob patterns; for example, `walrus store *.png --epochs <EPOCHS>` stores all PNG files in the current directory.
 
-:::warning End epoch
+### Blob lifetimes 
 
-A blob expires *at the beginning of its end epoch*. For example, a blob with end epoch `314` will
-become unavailable at the beginning of epoch `314`. One consequence of this is that when storing a

+### Blob permanence
 
-Up to (including) version 1.32, the CLI and [publisher](/usage/web-api.mdx) store blobs as *permanent* by
-default, requiring the user to explicitly specify a blob to be deletable. Starting with version
-1.33, newly stored blobs are *deletable* by default. If you care about the blob persistence, make

+You can specify whether a newly stored blob is deletable or permanent through the `--deletable` and `--permanent` option, respectively:
 
-:::
+- A permanent blob remains available until its expiry epoch. Not even the uploader can delete it beforehand.
 
-By default an owned `Blob` object is created. It is possible to wrap this into a shared object,
-which can be funded and extended by anyone, see the [shared blobs section](#shared-blobs).
+- In contrast, a deletable blob can be deleted at any point during its lifetime by the owner of the corresponding Sui object. See the [deletable blobs](#reclaim-space-through-deletable-blobs) for more details.
 
-When storing a blob, the client performs a number of automatic optimizations, including the
-following:
+Newly stored blobs are deletable by default. 
 
-- If the blob is already stored as a *permanent blob* on Walrus for a sufficient number of epochs
-  the command does not store it again. This behavior can be overwritten with the `--force`
-  CLI option, which stores the blob again and creates a fresh blob object on Sui belonging to the
-  wallet address.
-- If the user's wallet has a storage resource of suitable size and duration, it is (re-)used instead
-  of buying a new one.
-- If the blob is already certified on Walrus but as a *deletable* blob or not for a sufficient

 ## Shared blobs
 
-*Shared blobs* are shared Sui objects wrapping "standard" `Blob` objects that can be funded and
-whose lifetime can be extended by anyone. See the [shared blobs
-contracts](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/tree/main/contracts/walrus/sources/system/shared_blob.move)

 You can create a shared blob from an existing `Blob` object you own with the `walrus share` command:
 
 ```sh
-$ walrus share --blob-obj-id <BLOB_OBJ_ID>
+$ walrus share --blob-obj-id <SUI_OBJ_ID>
 ```
 
-The resulting shared blob can be directly funded by adding an `--amount`, or you can fund an
-existing shared blob with the `walrus fund-shared-blob` command. Additionally, you can immediately
-share a newly created blob by adding the `--share` option to the `walrus store` command.

 ### Prerequisites: Sui wallet and Testnet SUI {#prerequisites}
 
-Interacting with Walrus requires a valid Sui Testnet wallet with some amount of SUI tokens. The
-normal way to set this up is via the Sui CLI; see the [installation
-instructions](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install) in the Sui
-documentation.
-
-After installing the Sui CLI, you need to set up a Testnet wallet by running `sui client`, which
-prompts you to set up a new configuration. Make sure to point it to Sui Testnet, you can use the
-full node at `https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443` for this. See [the Sui
-documentation](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/connect) for further details.
-
-If you already have a Sui wallet configured, you can directly set up the Testnet environment (if you
-don't have it yet),
-
-```sh
-$ sui client new-env --alias testnet --rpc https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443
-```
-
-and switch the active environment to it:
-
-```sh
-$ sui client switch --env testnet
-```
-
-After this, you should get something like this (everything besides the `testnet` line is optional):
+<Tabs className="tabsHeadingCentered--small">

-*Quilt* is a batch storage feature, aiming to optimize the storage cost and efficiency of large
-numbers of small blobs. Prior to *quilt*, storing small blobs (less than 10MB) in Walrus
-involved higher per-byte costs due to internal system data overhead. *Quilt* addresses this by
-encoding multiple (up to 666 for QuiltV1) blobs into a single unit called a quilt, significantly
-reducing Walrus storage overhead and lowering costs to purchase Walrus/Sui storage, as well as Sui
-computation gas fees.
-
-Importantly, each blob within a quilt can be accessed and retrieved individually, without needing
-to download the entire quilt. Moreover, the blob boundaries in a quilt align with Walrus
-internal structures as well as Walrus storage nodes, this allows for retrieval latency that is
-comparable to, or even lower than, that of a regular blob.
-
-In addition, *quilt* introduces custom, immutable `Walrus-native` blob metadata, allowing user to
-assign different types of `metadata` to each blob in a quilt, for example, unique identifiers, as
-well as tags of key-value pairs. Note, this metadata is functionally similar to the existing
-Blob Metadata store on-chain, however, there are some fundamental distinctions. First,
-`Walrus-native` metadata is stored alongside the blob data, and hence it reduces costs and
-simplifies management. Second, this metadata can be used for efficient lookup of blobs within a
-quilt, for example, reading blobs with a particular tag. When storing a quilt, users can set
-the `Walrus-native` metadata via the *quilt* APIs.

 ## Important considerations
 
-It's important to note that blobs stored in a quilt are assigned a unique ID, called `QuiltPatchId`,
-that differs from the `BlobId` used for regular Walrus blobs, and a `QuiltPatchId` is determined by
-the composition of the entire quilt, ranther than the single blob, and hence it may change if the
-blob is stored in a different quilt. Moreover, individual blobs cannot be deleted, extended or shared
-separately; these operations can only be applied to the entire quilt.

Moreover, individual blobs cannot be deleted, extended, or shared separately. These operations can only be applied to the entire quilt.
 
 ## Target use cases
 
-Using *quilt* requires minimal additional effort beyond standard procedures. The primary
-considerations are that the unique ID assigned to each blob within a quilt cannot be
-directly derived from its contents, unlike a regular Walrus blob_id, deletion, extension
-and share operations are not allowed on individual blobs in the quilt, only the quilt
-can be the target.

 ### Lower cost

-In Walrus, anyone can delegate stake to storage nodes and, by doing so, influence, which storage
-nodes get selected for the committee in future epochs, and how many shards these nodes will hold.

Shards are assigned to storage nodes every epoch, roughly proportional to the amount of stake that was delegated to them.

-Since moving shards from one storage node to another requires transferring a lot of data, and

-For stake to affect the shard distribution in epoch `e` and become "active", it must be staked

-Unstaking has a similar delay: because unstaking funds only has an effect on the committee in
-the next committee selection, the stake will remain active until that committee takes over.
-This means that, to unstake at the start of epoch `e`, the user needs to "request withdrawal"
-before the midpoint of epoch `e - 1`. Otherwise, that is, if the user unstakes after this point,

-Storing blobs on Walrus Mainnet consumes WAL for the storage operation, and SUI for executing
-transactions on Sui. This section provides a summary of the costs involved, and also some
-advice on how to manage or minimize them for specific scenarios.
-
-This document deals with costs of storage specifically. You can find a wider discussion about
-the [WAL tokenonmics](https://www.walrus.xyz/wal-token), and the role it plays in the
-[Walrus delegated proof of stake system](/walrus.pdf) elsewhere.
-
-## Understanding the 4 Sources of Cost
+Storing blobs on Walrus Mainnet incurs two separate costs:
 
-The four sources of cost associated with Walrus Storage are acquiring storage resources, uploads,
-Sui transactions, and Sui objects on chain:
-
-- **Storage resources.** A storage resource is needed to store a blob, with an appropriate capacity
-  and epoch duration.
-  Storage resources can be acquired from the Walrus system contract while there is free space
-  available on the system against some WAL. Other options are also available, such as receiving it
-  from other parties, or splitting a larger resource bought occasionally into smaller ones (see
-  discussion below).
-
-- **Upload costs.** Upon blob registration, some WAL is charged to cover the costs of data upload.
-  This ensures that deleting blobs and reusing the same storage resource for storing a new blob is
-  sustainable for the system.
-
-- **Sui transactions.** Storing a blob involves up to three on-chain actions on Sui.
-  One to acquire a storage resource, another (possibly combined with the first) to
-  register the blob and associate it with a blob ID, and a final one to certify the blob
-  as available. These incur some Sui gas costs in SUI to cover the costs of
-  computation.
-
-- **On chain objects.** Finally, Walrus blobs are represented as Sui objects
-  on-chain. Creating these objects sets aside some SUI into the Sui storage fund,
-  and most of it is refunded when the objects are deleted after they are not needed
-  any more.
-
-The size of the storage resource needed to store a blob, and the size taken into account to pay
-for the upload costs, corresponds to the *encoded size* of a
-blob. The encoded size of a blob is the size of the erasure coded blob, which is about 5x larger
-than the unencoded original blob size, and the size of some metadata that is independent of the
-size of the blob. Since the fixed size per-blob metadata is quite large (about 64MB in the worse
-case), the cost of storing small blobs (< 10MB) is dominated by this, and the size of storing
-larger blobs is dominated by their increasing size. See
-[Reducing costs for small blobs](#reducing-costs-for-small-blobs) for more information on cost
-optimization strategies.
-
-The Walrus CLI uses some strategies to lower costs but is not guaranteed to be optimal for all
-use-cases. For high volume or other cost sensitive users there may be strategies that further
-lower costs, which we discuss below.
-
-## Measuring Costs
-
-The most accurate way to measure the costs of a store for a certain size is to perform a store
-for a blob of the same size, and observe the costs in SUI and WAL in a Sui explorer (or directly
-through Sui RPC calls). Blob contents do not affect costs.
-
-A `walrus store <FILENAME> --epochs 1` command will result in 2 transactions:
-
-- The first transaction will perform a `reserve_space` (if no storage resource of
-  appropriate size exists) and `register_blob`; and will affect the balances of both
-  SUI and WAL.
-
-- The second will perform a single call to `certify_blob` and will only change the SUI balance.
-
-You can observe the storage rebate on an explorer by burning the resulting blob objects
-using the command `walrus burn-blobs --object-ids <BLOB_OBJECT_ID>`. As discussed below,
-burning the object on Sui does not delete the blob on Walrus.
-
-As a rule of thumb, the SUI costs of `register_blob` and `certify_blob` are independent of
-blob size or epoch lifetime. The WAL costs of `register_blob` are linear in the encoded size of
-the blob (both erasure coding and metadata). Calls to `reserve_space` have SUI costs that
-grow in the number of epochs, and WAL costs linear with both encoded size and the number of epochs.
-
-A few commands output information that can assist in cost estimations, without submitting
-transactions:
-
-- The `walrus info` command displays the current costs for buying storage resources from the
-  system contract and also cost of uploads.
-
-- The `walrus store --dry-run ...` command outputs the encoded size that is used in calculations
-  of WAL costs. The `--dry-run` parameter ensures no transactions are submitted on chain.
-
-## Managing and Minimizing Costs
-
-There are multiple ways of acquiring storage resources, which impact their costs.
-
-The primary means is by sending some WAL to the Walrus system contract to "buy" a storage resource
-for some size in bytes and a defined lifetime in epochs.
-
-Furthermore, before acquiring a storage resource, the CLI client will use any user-owned storage
-resource of an appropriate length (in epochs and size in bytes). However, the current implementation
-does not make any attempts yet to properly split or merge storage resources.
-
-There are a few ways to minimize costs associated with the need for storage resources. First,
-acquiring resources from the system contract involves at least one Sui
-transaction interacting with a relatively complex shared object Sui smart contract. Therefore,
-acquiring larger storage resources at once both in length and size minimizes the SUI gas costs.
-Storage resources can then be split and merged to store smaller blobs or blobs for shorter time
-periods. Packing multiple smart contract calls into a single Sui PTB to manage storage resource
-acquisition, splitting and merging can also keep costs down.
-
-Storage resources can be reclaimed and reused for the remainder of their validity period,
-by deleting non-expired blobs that were created as *deletable*.
-Therefore, dapps that only need to store data for less time
-than a multiple of full epochs (two weeks on Mainnet), can potentially reduce costs by actively
-deleting blobs, and re-using the storage for other blobs.
-
-Storage resources can be transferred and traded, and we foresee other markets and ways to
-acquire them to exist in the future.
-
-Registering blobs and certifying them costs SUI to cover gas costs, and WAL to cover upload costs.
-Each blob needs to go through both of these and therefore not much may be done about these costs.
-However, multiple blobs may be registered or certified in a single Sui PTB both to reduce latency
-and, possibly, costs when storing multiple blobs. The CLI client uses this approach when uploading
-multiple blobs simultaneously. Within the same PTB storage resource management actions can also be
-performed to acquire storage or split/merge storage resources to further reduce latency and costs.
-
-Each blob stored on Walrus also creates a Sui object representing the blob. While these objects are
-not large and only contains metadata, storage on Sui is comparatively expensive and object costs
-can add up. Once the blob validity period expires the blob object has no use and can be burned.
-This will reclaim most of the storage costs associated with storage on Sui.
-
-The blob objects are used to manage blob lifecycle, such as extending blob lifetimes, deleting
-them to reclaim storage resources, or adding attributes. In case none of these actions are needed
-anymore, the blob object may be burned through the CLI or a smart contract call, to save on Sui
-storage costs. This does not delete the blob on Walrus. Depending on the relative costs of SUI and
-WAL it might be cheaper to burn a long lived blob object, and subsequently re-registering and
-re-certifying them close to the end of its lifetime to extend it.

-Quilt can also significantly reduce Sui computation and storage costs, as detailed in the

-## The Future
+:::caution 
 
-The Walrus team has planned initiatives to reduce costs for all blob sizes by making metadata
-smaller, as well as further improving the efficiency of Quilt for small blob storage.
+There are plans to stabilize costs to USD such that storage fees are not subject to WAL fluctuations. 
+
+:::
+
+## Cost calculator 
+
+Use the Walrus Cost Calculator for an interactive interface that can help estimate total storage costs: https://costcalculator.wal.app/
+
+For technical details on how costs are measured and calculated, refer to the [Measuring costs](#measuring-costs) section. 
+
+## Understanding sources of cost
+
+The sources of cost associated with Walrus Storage are:
+
+1. Acquiring storage resources
+
+1. Uploading blobs
+
+1. Creating Sui transactions
+
+1. Creating Sui objects on-chain
+
+### Storage resources 
+
+A storage resource is needed to store a blob, with an appropriate capacity and epoch duration. Storage resources can be acquired from the Walrus system contract while there is free space available on the system against some WAL. Other options are also available, such as receiving it from other parties, or splitting a larger resource bought occasionally into smaller resources.
+
+The size of the storage resource needed to store a blob and the size taken into account to pay for upload costs corresponds to the encoded size of a blob. The encoded size of a blob is the size of the erasure coded blob, which is about 5x larger than the unencoded original blob size, plus the size of metadata that is independent of the size of the blob. Since the fixed size per-blob metadata is quite large, at most about 64MB, the cost of storing small blobs (< 10MB) is dominated by this, and the size of storing larger blobs is dominated by their increasing size. See [Reducing costs for small blobs](#reducing-costs-for-small-blobs) for more information on cost optimization strategies.
+
+### Uploading blobs 
+
+Upon blob registration, some WAL is charged to cover the costs of data upload. This ensures that deleting blobs and reusing the same storage resource for storing a new blob is sustainable for the system.
+
+### Creating Sui transactions 
+
+Storing a blob involves up to 3 on-chain [transactions on Sui](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/transactions). One to acquire a storage resource, another that is possibly combined with the first to register the blob and associate it with a blob ID, and a final one to certify the blob as available. These incur gas fees in SUI to cover the costs of computation.
+
+### Creating Sui objects 
+
+Walrus blobs are represented as [Sui objects](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/objects/object-model) on-chain. Creating these objects sets aside some SUI into the [Sui storage fund](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/sui-architecture/sui-storage#storage-fund), and most of it is refunded when the objects are deleted after they are not needed anymore.
+
+## Measuring costs
+
+The most accurate way to measure costs is to upload a blob and observe the costs of SUI and WAL in a Sui explorer or directly through Sui RPC calls. Blob contents do not affect costs.
+
+For example, the following command results in 2 transactions:
+
+```
+$ walrus store <FILENAME> --epochs 1
+```
+
+1. The first transaction performs a `reserve_space` if no storage resource of appropriate size exists and `register_blob`. This affects the balances of both SUI and WAL. The SUI cost of `register_blob` is independent of blob size or epoch lifetime. The WAL costs of `register_blob` are linear in the encoded size of the blob, both erasure coding and metadata. Calls to `reserve_space` have SUI costs that grow in the number of epochs, and WAL costs linear with both encoded size and the number of epochs.
+
+2. The second performs a single call to `certify_blob` and only changes the SUI balance. The SUI cost of `certify_blob` is independent of blob size or epoch lifetime.
+
+You can observe the [storage rebate](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/sui-architecture/sui-storage#storage-rebates) on an explorer by burning the resulting blob objects using the command:
+
+```
+$ walrus burn-blobs --object-ids <BLOB_OBJECT_ID>
+```
+
+Burning the object on Sui does not delete the blob on Walrus.
+
+### Estimating costs programmatically
+
+A few commands output information that can assist in cost estimations without submitting transactions:
+
+- The `walrus info` command displays the current costs for buying storage resources from the system contract and cost of uploads.
+
+- The `walrus store --dry-run ...` command outputs the encoded size that is used in calculations of WAL costs. The `--dry-run` parameter ensures no transactions are submitted on-chain.
+
+## Acquiring storage resources
+
+You can acquire storage resources through different methods. Each method impacts the total storage cost:
+
+1. **Purchase from system contract**: Send WAL to the Walrus system contract to buy a storage resource for a specific size in bytes and lifetime in epochs. The `walrus info` command will display the current cost of buying storage resources from the storage contract.
+
+2. **Reuse existing resources you already own**: The CLI client automatically uses any user-owned storage resource of appropriate size and duration before purchasing new storage.
+
+3. **Transfer or trade**: Storage resources can be transferred between users or acquired through future marketplace implementations.
+
+## Optimizing storage resource costs
+
+The Walrus CLI uses strategies to lower costs, but is not guaranteed to be optimal for all use-cases. For high volume or other cost sensitive users, consider the following strategies to reduce costs.
+
+### Reducing costs for small blobs with Quilt
+
+Walrus [Quilt](/usage/quilt.mdx) is a batch storage tool that reduces storage costs for small blobs. When multiple blobs are stored together, the metadata costs are amortized across the batch. Quilt can also significantly reduce Sui computation and storage costs.
+
+### Buy larger resources in bulk
+
+Acquiring resources from the system contract requires at least one Sui transaction with a complex shared object smart contract. Purchasing larger storage resources at once, both in size and duration, minimizes SUI gas costs. You can then split and merge these resources as needed for smaller blobs or shorter time periods.
+
+### Use Sui PTBs efficiently
+
+Pack multiple smart contract calls into a single Sui [programmable transaction block (PTB)](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/transactions/prog-txn-blocks) to manage storage resource acquisition, splitting, and merging. This approach reduces both latency and costs.
+
+### Reclaim and reuse storage
+
+Storage resources can be reclaimed and reused by deleting non-expired blobs that were configure as deletable when created.. If your dApp only needs to store data for less than a full epoch (2 weeks on Mainnet), you can reduce costs by actively deleting blobs and reusing the storage space.
+
+## Optimizing blob operation costs
+
+You can also reduce costs by optimizing blob operations.
+
+### Batch blob operations
+
+Registering and certifying blobs costs SUI for gas and WAL for uploads. While each blob must go through both operations, you can register or certify multiple blobs in a single Sui PTB to reduce latency and costs. The CLI client uses this approach when uploading multiple blobs simultaneously.
+
+### Manage blob objects efficiently 
+
+Each blob stored on Walrus creates a Sui object containing metadata. While these objects are small, storage on Sui is expensive and costs accumulate. Once a blob's validity period expires, burn the blob object to reclaim most of the Sui storage costs through a [storage rebate](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/sui-architecture/sui-storage#storage-rebates). This does not delete the blob data on Walrus.
+
+### Consider blob object lifecycle
+
+Blob objects manage blob lifecycle operations such as extending lifetimes, deleting blobs to reclaim storage, or adding attributes. If you no longer need these capabilities, burn the blob object through the CLI or a smart contract call to save on Sui storage costs. Depending on the relative costs of SUI and WAL, it might be cheaper to burn a long-lived blob object and re-register and re-certify it close to the end of its lifetime to extend storage.

-## Availability
+## Data availability
 
-The encoding mechanisms applied by Walrus guarantee that blobs can be written and remains available
-as long as 2/3 of the data is handled by honest and functional nodes. Once data is written, reads
-are even possible if as few as 1/3 of the nodes are available. This is described in further detail

+The encoding mechanisms applied by Walrus guarantee that blobs can be written and remain available as long as 2/3 of the shards are operated by storage nodes that act honestly. Once data is written, reads are possible even if as few as 1/3 of the nodes are available. 
 
-## Integrity
+Each blob has a point of availability (PoA) observable through an event on Sui. Before the PoA, you are responsible for ensuring blob availability and upload to Walrus. After the PoA, Walrus is responsible for maintaining blob availability for the full storage period.
 
-Walrus guarantees that any data read corresponds to what was intended by the writer. As the encoding

-This causes some subtleties, which are described in the [encoding chapter](/design/encoding.mdx).
+If a blob is incorrectly encoded, storage nodes can produce an inconsistency proof. Reads for blob IDs with inconsistency proofs return `None`. Correctly stored blobs cannot have inconsistency proofs generated for them.

+## Nautilus: Secure and verifiable off-chain computation
+
+Nautilus is a framework for secure and verifiable off-chain computation on Sui. It enables you to delegate sensitive or resource-intensive tasks to a self-managed trusted execution environment (TEE) while using smart contract verification to preserve trust on-chain.
+
+Use Nautilus for hybrid dApps that require private data handling, complex computations, or integration with external Web2 systems. The framework ensures computations are tamper-resistant, isolated, and cryptographically verifiable.
+
+Nautilus currently supports self-managed AWS Nitro Enclave TEEs. You can verify AWS-signed enclave attestations on-chain using Move smart contracts. See the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/MystenLabs/nautilus) for the reproducible build template.
+
+### Use cases
+
+- **Trusted oracles**: Process off-chain data from Web2 services or decentralized storage platforms like Walrus in a tamper-resistant way.
+
+- **AI agents**: Securely run AI models for inference or execute agentic workflows while providing data and model provenance on-chain.
+
+- **DePIN solutions**: Enable private data computation in IoT and supply chain networks.
+
+- **Fraud prevention**: Secure order matching, settlement, and multi-party computations for DEXs and layer-2 solutions.
+
+- **Identity management**: Provide on-chain verifiability for decentralized governance with proof of tamper resistance.

 You can derive the blob ID of a file locally using the command: `walrus blob-id <file path>`.
 
+Blobs can be interacted with through familiar file system operations such as uploading, reading, downloading, and deleting. 
+
 ## Store
 
-Walrus may be used to **store a blob**, via the native client APIs or a publisher.
+The steps involved in a store operation can be executed by the binary client or a publisher that accepts and publishes blobs through HTTP. Specific usage workflows can be found in [Interacting with Walrus](/usage/interacting.mdx).
+
+:::danger

-to store anything that contains secrets or private data without additional measures to protect

 :::
 
-Under the hood a number of operations happen both on Sui as well as on storage nodes:
+When a blob is stored on Walrus, first the client or publisher encodes the blob and derives a blob ID that identifies the blob. This is a `u256` often encoded as a URL-safe base64 string. Then, a transaction is executed on Sui to purchase some storage from the system object and to register the blob ID occupying this storage. Client APIs return the Sui blob object ID. The transactions use SUI to purchase storage and pay for gas.
+
+Encoded slivers of the blob are distributed to all storage nodes. They each sign a receipt. Signed receipts are aggregated and submitted to the Sui blob object to certify the blob. Certifying a blob emits a Sui event with the blob ID and the period of availability.

-Walrus currently allows the storage of blobs up to a maximum size that may be determined
-through the [`walrus info`](/usage/client-cli.mdx#walrus-system-information) CLI command. The
-maximum blob size is currently 13.3&nbsp;GiB. You may store larger blobs by splitting them into

 ## Read
 
-Walrus can also be used to **read a blob** after it is stored by providing its blob ID.
-A read is executed by performing the following steps:
+Read a blob after it is stored by providing its blob ID. A read is executed by querying the system object on Sui to determine the Walrus storage node committee. Once the committee is determined, some of those storage nodes within the committee are queried for blob metadata and the slivers they store. The blob is reconstructed from the recovered slivers and checked against the blob ID.
+
+The steps involved in the read operation are performed by the binary client or the aggregator service that exposes an HTTP interface to read blobs. Reads are resilient and succeed in recovering the blob in all cases even if up to 1/3 of storage nodes are unavailable. In most cases, after synchronization is complete, blobs can be read even if 2/3 of storage nodes are down.
+
+## Download 
+
+To download a blob and save it on your local machine, run the following command:
+
+```sh
+$ walrus read <blob-id> --out file.txt --context testnet
+```
+
+Replace `<blob-id>` with the blob's identifier the `walrus store` command returns in its output, and replace `file.txt` with the name and file extension for storing the file locally.
 
-- The system object on Sui is read to determine the Walrus storage node committee.

+## Certify availability
 
-The steps involved in the read operation are performed by the binary client, or the aggregator
-service that exposes an HTTP interface to read blobs. Reads are extremely resilient and will succeed
-in recovering the blob in all cases even if up to one-third of storage nodes are unavailable. In

-are down.
+Once a blob is certified, Walrus ensures that sufficient slivers are always available on storage nodes to recover it within the specified epochs.
 
-## Certify Availability
+You can verify blob availability in 3 ways:
 
-Walrus can be used to **certify the availability of a blob** using Sui. Checking that this happened
-may currently be done in 3 different ways:
+1. **Using the certified blob event**: Use a Sui SDK read to authenticate the certified blob event emitted when the blob ID was certified on Sui. The `walrus blob-status` command identifies the event ID to check.
 
-- A Sui SDK read can be
-  used to authenticate the certified blob event emitted when the blob ID was certified on Sui. The
-  client `walrus blob-status` command may be used to identify the event ID that needs to be checked.
-- A Sui SDK read may be
-  used to authenticate the Sui blob object corresponding to the blob ID, and check it is certified,
-  before the expiry epoch, and not deletable.
-- A Sui smart contract can read the blob object on Sui (or a reference to it) to check
-  it is certified, before the expiry epoch, and not deletable.

-returns digitally signed evidence for emitted events
-or objects, and can be used by off-line or non-interactive applications as a proof of availability
-for the blob ID for a certain number of epochs.

 ## Delete
 
-Stored blobs can be optionally set as deletable by the user that creates them. This metadata is

+Walrus blobs are represented as Sui objects of type `Blob`. A blob is first registered, indicating that the storage nodes should expect slivers from a blob ID to be stored. Then a blob is certified, indicating that a sufficient number of slivers have been stored to guarantee the blob's availability. When a blob is certified, its `certified_epoch` field contains the epoch in which it was certified.

-## Publisher Operation and Configuration
-
-This section lists a few important details on how the publisher deals with funds and
-objects on Sui.
-
-### Number of Sub-Wallets and Upload Concurrency
-
-As mentioned previously, the publisher uses sub-wallets to allow storing blobs in parallel.
-By default, the publisher uses 8 sub-wallets, meaning it can handle 8 blob store HTTP requests concurrently.
-
-To operate a high-performance and concurrency publisher, the following options
-might be of interest:
-
-- The `--n-clients <NUM>` option creates a number of separate wallets used to perform concurrent
-    Sui chain operations. Increase this to allow more parallel uploads. A higher number
-    requires more SUI and WAL coins initially to be distributed to more wallets.
-
-- The `--max-concurrent-requests <NUM>` determines how many concurrent requests can be handled,
-  including Sui operations (limited by number of clients) but also uploads. After this is exceeded,
-  more requests are queued up to the `--max-buffer-size <NUM>`, after which requests are rejected
-  with an HTTP 429 code.
-
-### SUI Coin Management in Sub-Wallets
-
-Each of the sub-wallets requires funds to interact with the chain and purchase storage.
-For this reason, a background process checks periodically if the sub-wallets have enough
-funds. In steady state, each of the sub-wallets has a balance of 0.5-1.0 SUI and WAL.
-You can configure the amount and triggers for coin refills through CLI arguments.
-
-To tweak how refills are handled, you can use the `--refill-interval <REFILL_INTERVAL>`,
-`--gas-refill-amount <GAS_REFILL_AMOUNT>`, `--wal-refill-amount <WAL_REFILL_AMOUNT>`,
-and `--sub-wallets-min-balance <SUB_WALLETS_MIN_BALANCE>` arguments.
-
-### Lifecycle of Created `Blob` On-Chain Objects
-
-Each store operation in Walrus creates a `Blob` object on Sui. This blob object represents the
-(partial) ownership over the associated data, and allows certain data management operations
-(for example, in the case of deletable blobs).
-
-When the publisher stores a blob on behalf of a client, the `Blob` object is initially owned by the
-sub-wallet that stored the blob. Then, the following cases are possible, depending on the
-configuration:
-
-- If the client requests to store a blob and specifies the `send_object_to` query
-  parameter (see [the relevant section](/usage/web-api.mdx#store) for examples), then
-  the `Blob` object is transferred to the specified address. This is a way for clients
-  to get back the created object for their data.
-- If the `send_object_to` query parameter is not specified, two cases are possible:
-  - By default the sub-wallet transfers the
-    newly-created blob object to the main wallet, such that all these objects are kept there.
-    This behavior can be changed by setting the `--burn-after-store` flag, and the blob object
-    is then immediately deleted.
-  - However, note that this flag *does not affect* the use of the `send_object_to` query parameter:
-    Regardless of this flag's status, the publisher will send created objects to the address in
-    the `send_object_to` query parameter, if it is specified in the PUT request.
-
-### Advanced publisher uses
-
-The setup and use of an authenticated publisher is covered in a [separate section](/operator-guide/auth-publisher.mdx).
-
-### Advanced aggregator uses
+### Support large files
 
-#### Large file support
-
-As of Walrus `v1.38.0` the aggregator can perform concatenation of multiple blobs via the
-`/v1alpha/blobs/concat` endpoint. This endpoint enables delivery of very large files - which would
-otherwise be unsupported due to individual blob size restrictions. The
-`walrus-store-sliced.sh` script that follows shows an example of how a very large file can be sliced and uploaded to Walrus. Once the slices are uploaded, the very large file can be read directly by your downstream users by `GET` URL construction (listing the blob slices in the query params), or via a `POST` request with a JSON body listing the ids. Details of this api are available in the online aggregator docs. These can be found at `<your-aggregator-url>/v1/api`. Note that this endpoint is still under development and its specifications or behavior may change prior to becoming stable.

-We now describe the authenticated publisher, which requires the HTTP request to store a blob to be
-authenticated. Such an authenticated publisher can be used as a building block for services that
-require storing over HTTP on Walrus `mainnet`, where an "open" publisher is undesirable (because of
-the `SUI` and `WAL` cost of publishing to Walrus).
-
-## Overview
-
-The Walrus Publisher can be configured to require a JWT (JSON web Token) with each HTTP request, for
-user authentication. The authentication system ensures that only authorized clients can store blobs
-and allows for fine-grained control over storage parameters through JWT claims.
-
-The authenticated publishing flow occurs, at a high level, as follows:
-
-1. **Publisher setup**: The publisher operator:
-    - Funds the publisher's wallet with sufficient `SUI` and `WAL`;
-    - Configures the publisher to only accept authenticated requests. This entails setting the
-    algorithm to authenticate JWTs, the expiration time for JWTs, and the JWT authentication
-    secret.
-1. **Authentication channel setup**: The publisher operator sets up a channel through which users
-    can obtain the JWT tokens. This step can be performed in any way that produces a valid JWT, and
-    is not provided in this implementation.
-1. **Client authentication**: The client obtains a JWT token from the channel set up in the previous
-    step. The JWT token can specify Walrus-relevant constraints, such as the maximum number of epochs
-    the JWT can be used to store for, and the maximum size of the blobs being stored.
-1. **Publish request**: The client requests to store a blob using the publisher. This is done
-    through an HTTP PUT request containing the JWT in an Authorization Bearer HTTP header.
-1. **Store to Walrus**: The publisher checks the JWT, and checks that the store request is compliant
-    with the constraints specified in the JWT (e.g., the blob being stored is smaller than the
-    authorized max size).
-1. (Optional) **Asset return:**: If so specified, the publisher returns the newly-created `Blob`
-    object to the Sui Address set in the request.
-
-### Request Authentication Flow
-
-We now provide an example of how the authenticated publisher can be used in a webapp that allows
-users to upload files to Walrus through a web frontend. This is especially useful if the users are
-*not* required to have a wallet, and therefore cannot store blobs to Walrus on their own.
-
-- The user connects to the webapp, authenticates (e.g., through name and password, as they have no
-  wallet).
-- The user uploads the file it wants to store, and selects the number of epochs for which it would
-  like to store it.
-- The webapp frontend sends information on the size of the file and the number of epochs to the
-  backend.
-- With this information, the backend computes if the user is authorized to store the given amount of
-  data for the selected number of epochs, and possibly reduces the user quota. This accounting can
-  be done locally, but also directly on Sui. Importantly, at this point the backend can also check
-  the cost of the upload (in terms of SUI and WAL), and check if it is within the user's budget.
-- If the user is authorized to store, the backend returns a JWT token with the size and epoch limits
-  to the frontend.
-- The frontend sends the file to the publisher via a `PUT` request, setting the JWT in the
-  Authorization header as a Bearer token.
-- Upon receipt, the publisher verifies:
-  - The token signature using the configured secret;
-  - Token expiration;
-  - Token uniqueness (prevents replay attacks);
-  - Upload parameters against claims (if enabled).
-- If all checks succeed, the publisher stores the file on Walrus.
-- If set, the publisher finally returns the created `Blob` object to the address specified by the
-  user.
-
-One important note here is that the JWT token itself is a "single use" token, and should not be used
-for accounting purposes. I.e., one token can be used to store only one file, and after that the
-token is rejected by the replay suppression system.
-
-## Publisher setup
-
-The publisher is configured at startup using the following command line arguments:
-
-- `--jwt-decode-secret`: The secret key used to verify JWT signatures. If set, the publisher will
-  only store blobs with valid JWTs.
+The authenticated publisher requires HTTP requests to store a blob to be authenticated. Use an authenticated publisher as a building block for services that require storing over HTTP on Walrus Mainnet, where an open publisher is undesirable because of the SUI and WAL cost of publishing to Walrus.
+
+Configure the Walrus Publisher to require a JWT (JSON Web Token) with each HTTP request for user authentication. The authentication system ensures that only authorized clients can store blobs and allows for fine-grained control over storage parameters through JWT claims.
+
+The authenticated publishing flow occurs as follows:

+1. **Client authentication**: The client obtains a JWT token from the channel set up in the previous step. The JWT token can specify Walrus-relevant constraints, such as the maximum number of epochs the JWT can be used to store for, and the maximum size of the blobs being stored.
+
+1. **Publish request**: The client requests to store a blob using the publisher. This is done through an HTTP PUT request containing the JWT in an Authorization Bearer HTTP header.
+
+1. **Store to Walrus**: The publisher checks the JWT, and checks that the store request is compliant with the constraints specified in the JWT, for example, the blob being stored is smaller than the authorized max size.
+
+6. Optional: **Asset return**: If so specified, the publisher returns the newly-created `Blob` object to the Sui Address set in the request.
+
+## Understand the authentication flow
+
+The authenticated publisher enables web apps to let users upload files to Walrus without requiring them to have a wallet. The following example demonstrates a typical workflow where users authenticate through the webapp using credentials like username and password rather than a blockchain wallet.
+
+**User authentication and upload request**
+
+The user logs into the webapp and selects a file to upload. They choose how many epochs to store the file for. The webapp frontend sends the file size and epoch count to the backend.
+
+**Backend authorization and JWT generation**
+
+The backend verifies the user is authorized to store this amount of data for the requested duration. It checks:
+
+- User quota and reduces it if needed
+- Cost of the upload in SUI and WAL
+- Whether the cost fits within the user's budget
+
+This accounting can be done locally or directly on Sui. If authorized, the backend generates a JWT token containing the approved size and epoch limits, then sends it to the frontend.
+
+**Publisher request and verification**
+
+The frontend sends the file to the publisher using a `PUT` request with the JWT in the Authorization Bearer header. The publisher verifies:
+
+- Token signature matches the configured secret
+
+- Token has not expired
+
+- Token has not been used before (prevents replay attacks)
+
+- Upload parameters match the JWT claims (if verification is enabled)
+
+**Storage and object return**
+
+If all checks pass, the publisher stores the file on Walrus. If configured, the publisher returns the created `Blob` object to the specified Sui address.
+
+:::info
+
+Each JWT token can only be used once. After storing 1 file, the replay suppression system rejects the token. Do not use JWT tokens for accounting purposes.
+
+:::
+
+## Set up the publisher
+
+Configure the publisher at startup using the following command line arguments:
+
+- `--jwt-decode-secret`: The secret key used to verify JWT signatures. If set, the publisher only stores blobs with valid JWTs.
+
 - `--jwt-algorithm`: The algorithm used for JWT verification (defaults to HMAC).
+
 - `--jwt-expiring-sec`: Duration in seconds after which the JWT is considered expired.
+
 - `--jwt-verify-upload`: Enable verification of upload parameters against JWT claims.
 
-Additional details follow.
+### Set the JWT decode secret
+
+The secret can be a hexadecimal string, starting with `0x`. If this parameter is not specified, the authentication is disabled.
+
+All JWT tokens are expected to have the `jti` (JWT ID) set in the claim to a unique value. The JWT is used for replay suppression, to avoid malicious users storing multiple times using the same JWT. Therefore, the JWT creator must ensure that this value is unique among all requests to the publisher. Using large nonces to avoid collisions is recommended.
 
-### The JWT Decode Secret
+### Choose an authentication algorithm
 
-The secret can be hex string, starting with `0x`. If this parameter is not specified, the
-authentication will be disabled.
+The following algorithms are supported: HS256, HS384, HS512, ES256, ES384, RS256, RS384, PS256, PS384, PS512, RS512, and EdDSA. The default JWT authentication algorithm is HS256.

-be HS256.
+### Verify upload parameters

-If the parameter is set and greater than 0, the publisher will check if the JWT token is expired
-based on the "issued at" (`iat`) value in the JWT token.
+Specifically, the publisher:
 
-### Upload parameters verification
+- Verifies that the number of `epochs` in query is the same as `epochs` in the JWT, if present.
 
-If set, the publisher will verify that the requested upload matches the claims in the JWT. This
-*does not* enable or disable the cryptographic authentication of the JWT; it just enables or
-disables the checks that ensure the contents of the JWT claim match the requested blob upload.
+- Verifies that the `send_object_to` field in the query is the same as the `send_object_to` in the JWT, if present.
 
-Specifically, the publisher will:
+- Verifies the size of uploaded file.
 
-- Verify that the number of `epochs` in query is the the same as `epochs` in the JWT, if present;
-- Verify that the `send_object_to` field in the query is the same as the `send_object_to` in the
-  JWT, if present;
-- Verify the size of uploaded file;
-- Verify the uniqueness of the `jti` claim.
+- Verifies the uniqueness of the `jti` claim.
 
-Disabiling the parameter verification may be useful in case the source of the store requests is
-trusted, but the publisher mayy be contacted by untrusted sources. In that case, the authentication
-of the JWT is necessary, but not the verification of the upload parameters.

 ## Design
 
-### Outline
-
 At a high level, a client stores a blob using an upload relay as follows:
 
-1. First, the client locally encodes the blob and registers it on Sui;
-1. then, the client sends the blob to the upload relay via an HTTP POST request to the blob-relay
-  endpoint (`/v1/blob-upload-relay`);
-1. the upload relay then encodes the blob, sends the slivers to the storage nodes, collects a storage
-  confirmation certificate, and sends it back to the client;
-1. finally, the client uses the confirmation certificate to certify the blob on Sui.

-and TS SDK, and therefore developers do not need to implement it themselves. For completeness, in
-the following we discuss how the service is implemented, paid for, and used by clients.

-### Upload Relay Operation
+The flow between clients and the upload relay is already implemented in the Walrus CLI, Rust SDK, and TS SDK, and therefore developers do not need to implement it themselves. For completeness, the following sections discuss how the service is implemented, paid for, and used by clients.
 
-The upload relay can be operated in two ways:
+### Operate the upload relay
 
-- **Free service**: It accepts simple HTTP POST requests with blobs from clients, and relays them to
-  the storage nodes for free.
-- **Paid service** (for public relays): In this configuration, the upload relay requires a *tip* to
-  relay a blob. The tip can be used by the relay operator to cover the costs of running the
-  infrastructure and turn a profit on the service. At the moment, we allow a constant tip, and a tip
-  that is linear in the unencoded data size.
+The upload relay can be operated in 2 ways:
 
-Upload relays expose a tip-configuration endpoint (`/v1/tip-config`) that returns the tipping
-configuration. For example:
+- **Free service**: It accepts simple HTTP POST requests with blobs from clients, and relays them to the storage nodes for free.
+
+- **Paid service** for public relays: In this configuration, the upload relay requires a tip to relay a blob.

At the moment, a constant tip and a tip that is linear in the unencoded data size are allowed.

-### Paying the Tip
+### Pay the tip
 
 This step is only necessary if the relay requires a tip.
 
 To pay the tip, the client proceeds as follows:
 
-1. it computes the `blob_digest = SHA256(blob)`
-1. it generates a random `nonce`, and hashes it `nonce_digest = SHA256(nonce)`
-1. it computes the `unencoded_length = blob.len()`
+1. It computes the `blob_digest = SHA256(blob)`.
+
+2. It generates a random `nonce`, and hashes it `nonce_digest = SHA256(nonce)`.
+
+3. It computes the `unencoded_length = blob.len()`.
 
-Then, it creates a PTB, where the first input (`input 0`) is the `bcs` encoded representation of
-`blob_digest || nonce_digest || unencoded_length`. This will later be used by the relay to
-authenticate the sender of the store request. In the same PTB, the client transfers the appropriate
-tip amount to the relay’s wallet (also found through the `/v1/tip-config` endpoint). Usually, the
-client would also register the blob in this transaction. This is not mandatory, and the blob can be
-registered in another transaction, but it is commonly convenient and cheaper to perform all these
-operations together.
+Then, it creates a [programmable transaction block (PTB)](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/transactions/prog-txn-blocks), where the first input `0` is the `bcs` encoded representation of `blob_digest || nonce_digest || unencoded_length`. This is later used by the relay to authenticate the sender of the store request. In the same PTB, the client transfers the appropriate tip amount to the relay's wallet . This can also be found through the `/v1/tip-config` endpoint. Usually, the client also registers the blob in this transaction. This is not mandatory, and the blob can be registered in another transaction, but it is commonly convenient and cheaper to perform all these operations together.
 
-Once the transaction is executed, the client keeps the transaction ID `tx_id` , the `nonce`, and the
-`blob_id`, which are required for the next phase.
+After the transaction is executed, the client keeps the transaction ID `tx_id`, the `nonce`, and the `blob_id`, which are required for the next phase.
 
-Note: the relay will enforce a freshness check on the transaction that paid the tip (currently 1h by
-default, but each relay can independently configure this).

commit 0173958c2c8a243932d72c4f41c6e5ae42977453
Author: Markus Legner <mlegner@users.noreply.github.com>
Date:   Sat Dec 13 22:49:31 2025 +0100

    test: various test improvements (#2759)
    
    * Disable optimization for tests by default; enable for E2E tests in CI.
    * Improve some test parameters.
    * Ignore some long-running tests by default.
    * Improve `simtest_param_test` macro.
    * Re-implement the previously problematic test
      `correctly_handles_blob_deletions_with_concurrent_instances` as a
      simtest.

-Walrus supports operations to store and read blobs, and to prove and verify their availability.
-It ensures content survives storage nodes suffering Byzantine faults and remains available and
-retrievable. It provides APIs to access the stored content over a CLI, SDKs and over web2 HTTP
-technologies, and supports content delivery infrastructures like caches and content distribution
-networks (CDNs).
-
-Under the hood, storage cost is a small fixed multiple of the size of blobs (around 5x). Advanced
-erasure coding keeps the cost low, in contrast to the full replication of data traditional to
-blockchains, such as the >100x multiple for data stored in Sui objects. As a result, storage of much
-bigger resources (up to several GiB) is possible on Walrus at substantially lower cost than on Sui
-or other blockchains. Because encoded blobs are stored on all storage nodes, Walrus also provides
-superior robustness than designs with a small amount of replicas storing the full blob.
-
-Walrus uses the Sui chain for coordination and payments. Available storage is represented as Sui
-objects that can be acquired, owned, split, merged, and transferred. Storage space can be tied to
-a stored blob for a period of time, with the resulting Sui object used to prove
-availability on chain in smart contracts, or off chain using light clients.
-
-The [next chapter](/design/overview.mdx) discusses the above operations relating to storage,
-retrieval, and availability in detail.
-
-In the future, we plan to include in Walrus some minimal governance to allow storage nodes to
-change between storage epochs. Walrus is also compatible with periodic payments for continued
-storage. We also plan to implement storage attestation based on challenges to get confidence
-that blobs are stored or at least available. Walrus also allows light nodes that store small parts
-of blobs to get rewards for proving availability and assisting recovery. We will cover these
-topics in later documents. We also provide details of the encoding scheme in a separate document.
+Walrus supports operations to store and read blobs, and to prove and verify their availability. It ensures that content survives storage nodes suffering Byzantine faults, remaining available and retrievable. It provides APIs to access the stored content over [CLI, SDKs, and Web2 HTTP technologies](/usage/interacting.mdx), and supports content delivery infrastructures like caches and content distribution networks (CDNs).
+
+Under the hood, [storage cost](/dev-guide/costs.mdx) is a small fixed multiple of the size of blobs (around 5x). Advanced erasure coding keeps the cost low, in contrast to the full replication of data traditional to blockchains, such as the >100x multiple for data stored in Sui objects. As a result, storage of large resources (multiple GB) is possible on Walrus at substantially lower cost than on Sui or other blockchains. Because all storage nodes store encoded blobs, Walrus also provides superior robustness compared to designs using a small amount of replicas to store the full blob.
+
+Walrus uses the [Sui chain](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui) for coordination and payments. Available storage is represented as Sui objects that can be acquired, owned, split, merged, and transferred. Storage space can be tied to a stored blob for a period of time, with the resulting Sui object used to prove availability either on-chain in smart contracts, or off-chain using light clients.
+
+Currently, Walrus is compatible with periodic payments for continued storage. It also allows light nodes to get rewards for storing small parts of blobs, proving availability, and assisting recovery. Future plans include implementing some minimal governance to allow storage nodes to change between storage epochs, as well as challenge-based storage attestation for blob storage and availability confidence. These topics will be covered in later documents, and encoding scheme details will also be provided in a separate document.
 
 ## Non-objectives
 
 There are a few things that Walrus explicitly is not:
 
-- Walrus does not reimplement a CDN that might be geo-replicated or have less than tens of
-  milliseconds of latency. Instead, it ensures that traditional CDNs are usable and compatible with
-  Walrus caches.

-- Walrus does not re-implement a full smart contracts platform with consensus or execution. It
-  relies on Sui smart contracts when necessary, to manage Walrus resources and processes including
-  payments, storage epochs, and so on.

-- Walrus supports storage of any blob, including encrypted blobs. However, Walrus itself is not the
-  distributed key management infrastructure that manages and distributed encryption or decryption
-  keys to support a full private storage eco-system. It can, however, provide the storage layer for
-  such infrastructures.

 ## Use Cases
 
-App builders may use Walrus in conjunction with any L1 or L2 blockchains to build experiences that
-require large amounts of data to be stored in a decentralized manner and possibly certified as
-available:
-
-- **Storage of media for NFT or dApps:** Walrus can directly store and serve media such as images,
-  sounds, sprites, videos, other game assets, and so on. This is publicly available media that is
-  accessed using HTTP requests at caches to create multimedia dApps.
-
-- **AI related use cases:** Walrus can store clean data sets of training data, datasets with a
-  known and verified provenance, models, weights and proofs of correct training for AI models.
-  It can also store and ensure the availability of an AI model output.
-
-- **Storage of long term archival of blockchain history:** Walrus can act as a lower-cost
-  decentralized store to store blockchain history. For Sui, this can include sequences of
-  checkpoints with all associated transaction and effects content, as well as historic snapshots
-  of the blockchain state, code, or binaries.
-
-- **Support availability for L2s:** Walrus allows parties to certify the availability of blobs, as
-  required by L2s that need data to be stored and be attested as available to all. This may also
-  include availability of extra audit data such as validity proofs, zero knowledge proofs of
-  correct execution or large fraud proofs.
-
-- **Support a fully decentralized web experience:** Walrus can host fully decentralized web
-  experiences, including all resources (such as js, css, html, media). These can not only
-  provide content, but also host the UX of dApps to enable applications with fully decentralized
-  front end and back ends on chain. Walrus puts the full "web" into web3.
-
-- **Support subscription models for media:** Creators can store encrypted media on Walrus and only
-  provide access via decryption keys to parties that have paid a subscription fee or have paid for
-  content. Walrus provides the storage, encryption and decryption needs to happen off
-  the system.

+- **Support AI-related use cases:** Walrus can store clean data sets of training data, datasets with a known and verified provenance, models, weights, and proofs of correct training for AI models. It can also store and ensure the availability of an AI model output. [OpenGradient](https://www.opengradient.ai/) and [Talus](https://talus.network/) are two live examples built on Walrus.
+
+- **Store media for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or dApps:** Walrus can directly store and serve media such as images, sounds, sprites, videos, game assets, and so on. This is publicly available media that is accessed using HTTP requests at caches to create multimedia dApps. See [Pudgy Penguins](https://pudgypenguins.com/) for an example of Walrus-stored NFTs.

+- **Support a fully decentralized web experience:** Walrus can host fully decentralized web experiences, including all resources such as JavaScript, CSS, HTML, or media. These web experiences are capable of both providing content, as well as hosting the UX of dApps to enable applications with fully decentralized front ends and back ends on-chain. To learn more, see [Introduction to Walrus Sites](/walrus-sites/intro.mdx).
+
+- **Support subscription models for media:** Creators can store encrypted media on Walrus and limit access through decryption keys to parties who have paid a subscription fee or have paid for content. Walrus provides the needed off-system storage, encryption, and decryption.

 network with its own utility token, WAL, that will play a key role in the operation and governance
 of the network. Walrus will be operated by storage nodes through a delegated proof-of-stake
 mechanism using the WAL token. An independent Walrus foundation will encourage the advancement and

-# Developer guide
-
-This guide introduces all the concepts needed to build applications that use Walrus as a storage
-or availability layer. The [overview](../design/overview.md) provides more background and explains
-in more detail how Walrus operates internally.
-
-This developer guide describes the following:
-
-- [Components](components.md) of Walrus of interest to developers that wish to use it for
-  storage or availability.
-- [Operations](dev-operations.md) supported through client binaries, APIs, or Sui operations.
-- [Cost](costs.md) components of storage, how they are measured, and considerations for managing those.
-- [The Sui structures](sui-struct.md) Walrus uses to store metadata, and how they can be read
-  from Sui smart contracts, or through the Sui SDK.
-- [Data security](data-security.md) guidance for encryption and access control of data stored on Walrus.
-
-Refer again to the [glossary](../glossary.md) of terms as a reference.

-# Walrus Glossary
-
-To make communication as clear and efficient as possible, we make sure to use a single term for
-every Walrus entity/concept and *do not* use any synonyms. The following table lists various
-concepts, their canonical name, and how they relate to or differ from other terms.
-
-Italicized terms in the description indicate other specific Walrus terms contained in the table.

-| blob metadata                     | metadata of one *blob*; in particular, this contains a hash per *shard* to enable the authentication of *slivers* and recovery symbols                                                      |
-| cache                             | an *aggregator* with additional caching capabilities                                                                                                                                        |
-| certificate of availability (CoA) | a *blob ID* with signatures of *storage nodes* holding at least \(2f+1\) *shards* in a specific *epoch*                                                                                     |
-| client                            | entity interacting directly with the *storage nodes*; this can be an *aggregator*/*cache*, a *publisher*, or an *user*                                                                      |
-| committee                         | the set of *storage nodes* for a particular *epoch*, including metadata about the *shards* they are responsible for and other metadata                                                      |
-| deletable blob                    | blob which can be deleted by its owner at any time to be able to reuse the storage resource                                                                                                 |
-| end epoch                         | the *epoch* at which a blob will no longer be available for reads; the end epoch is always **exclusive**                                                                                    |
-| epoch                             | Walrus uses epochs to track committee changes (like Sui) and measure lifetimes of blobs; the epoch duration for Walrus differs from Sui; on Mainnet the epoch duration is two weeks         |
-| expiry                            | a blob becomes unavailable and can be deleted by storage nodes at its *end epoch*                                                                                                           |
-| FROST                             | the smallest unit of WAL (similar to MIST for SUI); 1 WAL is equal to 1 billion (1000000000) FROST                                                                                          |
-| inconsistency certificate         | an aggregated signature from 2/3 of *storage nodes* (weighted by their number of *shards*) that they have seen and stored an *inconsistency proof* for a *blob ID*                          |
-| inconsistency proof               | set of several recovery symbols with their Merkle proofs such that the decoded *sliver* does not match the corresponding hash; this proves an incorrect/inconsistent encoding by the client |
-| member                            | an *storage node* that is part of a *committee* at some *epoch*                                                                                                                             |

-# Examples
-
-As inspiration, we provide several simple examples in different programming languages to interact
-with Walrus through the various interfaces. They are located at
-<https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/tree/main/docs/examples> and described below.
-
-In addition, we have built actual applications on top of Walrus. The prime example is [Walrus
-Sites](../walrus-sites/intro.md), with code available in the
-<https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-sites> repository.
-
-And for an example of how to build a static website and store it as a Walrus Site with GitHub
-actions, just look at the [CI
-workflow](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-docs/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yaml) we use
-to publish this very site. There is also a [Walrus-Sites GitHub
-Action](https://github.com/zktx-io/walrus-sites-ga) created by the community you can use to very
-easily publish your own Walrus Sites using GitHub Actions (note that this is *not* created or
-officially supported by the Walrus team at Mysten Labs).
-
-See also our list of existing and upcoming [SDKs and other tools](./sdks.md).
-
-## Python
-
-The [Python examples](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/tree/main/docs/examples/python) folder
-contains a number of examples:
-
-- How to [use the HTTP
-  API](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/blob/main/docs/examples/python/hello_walrus_webapi.py)
-  to store and read a blob.
-- How to [use the JSON
-  API](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/blob/main/docs/examples/python/hello_walrus_jsonapi.py)
-  to store, read, and check the availability of a blob. Checking the certification of a blob
-  illustrates reading the Blob Sui object that certifies (see the [Walrus Sui
-  reference](../dev-guide/sui-struct.md)).
-- How to [track Walrus related
-  Events](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/blob/main/docs/examples/python/track_walrus_events.py).
-
-## JavaScript
-
-A [JavaScript example](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/tree/main/docs/examples/javascript) is
-provided showing how to upload and download a blob through a web form using the HTTP API.
-
-## Move
-
-For more complex applications, you may want to interact with Walrus on-chain objects. For that
-purpose, the currently deployed Walrus contracts are included [in our GitHub
-repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/tree/main/contracts).
-
-Furthermore, we provide a simple [example
-contract](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/tree/main/docs/examples/move) that imports and uses
-the Walrus objects.

 Blobs within a quilt can be accessed and filtered based on their tags. For instance, if you have a
 collection of animal images stored in a quilt, each labeled with a species tag such as "species=cat,"
 you can download **all** images labeled as cats with the following command:
 
+Read all blobs with tag "size: medium":

 You can also read a blob using its QuiltPatchId, which can be retrieved using
 [`list-patches-in-quilt`](#list-patches-in-a-quilt).

-# The RedStuff Encoding Algorithm
-
-The RedStuff encoding algorithm used in Walrus is an adaptation of the _Twin-Code framework_ presented by Rashmi et al. [^twincode].
-
-## Goals & Overview
-
-The goal of the Walrus system is to provide a distributed storage infrastructure, where a decentralized set of entities—the _storage
-nodes_—collaborate to store and serve files ("blobs" of data). When it comes to storage properties, Walrus has a three key goals:
-
-1. To support extremely high availability and durability of the data;
-2. to have low storage overhead _compared to full replication_, i.e., we don't want to store each blob on every storage node;
-3. to gracefully support node failures, and in particular to allow for _efficient node recovery_ (more on this later).
-
-Given these requirements, one good option is to _erasure encode_ the blobs across the storage nodes. At a high level, erasure encoding (or erasure
-coding) allows to encode the data into $N$ parts, such that the aggregate size of the $N$ blobs is a small multiple of the original blob size, and a
-_subset_ $k$ of these parts is sufficient to recover the original blob. We formalize these concepts in the next section, but now note that erasure
-coding already allows us to achieve goals (1) and (2) above, because:
-
-1. Erasure coding allows to recover a blob even if $N - k$ storage nodes fail, providing high availability and durability to the data;
-2. the overall storage overhead is much smaller than for full replication, as for a blob of size $S$, the total storage used in the system is
-   $S \cdot c$ instead of $S \cdot N$, where $c \ll N$ is a small constant (4.5 in Walrus's case).
-
-To achieve the third requirement, however, simple erasure coding is insufficient: A failed node that wants to reconstruct its part of the encoding
-needs to first fetch at least $k$ other parts, reconstruct the blob, and then re-encode its own part. Therefore, the communication overhead for
-recovery is on the order of the size of the whole blob, $S$. With RedStuff, we are instead capable of reconstructing the encoded part of a failed node
-by fetching only $O(S/N)$ data, i.e., only in the order of the size of the lost part. Thus, we can achieve (3).
-
-## Background
-
-We provide here the essential background on the coding schemes used in RedStuff.
-
-### Erasure Codes
-
-Erasure coding considers the problem of error correction in the case of _bit erasures_, i.e., some bits in the message are lost, as in the case of a
-lossy channel. In general, an erasure code divides a blob (or message) of $S$ bytes into $k$ _symbols_ (bitstrings of fixed length $~S/k$), which are
-then encoded to form a longer message of $N$ symbols, such that the original blob can be recovered from any subset $k'$ of the $N$ symbols. $k/N$ is
-called _code rate_.
-
-### Fountain Codes
-
-Fountain codes are a class of erasure codes. The key property of fountain codes is that the encoding process is _rateless_, i.e., the encoder can
-produce an arbitrary number of encoded parts on the fly, without knowing the total number of parts that will be produced. This is useful for the
-RedStuff use case, as it allows us to specify the rate of the encoder (e.g., by encoding $f+1$ source symbols into $N$ recovery symbols, we guarantee
-that any subset of $f+1$ symbols can reconstruct the source). Further, fountain codes are extremely efficient as they typically require XOR operations
-to encode and decode the data.
-
-### RaptorQ
-
-RedStuff is based on the RaptorQ fountain code. RaptorQ is one of the fastest and most efficient fountain codes, and has the following properties:
-
-1. It is _systematic_, i.e., the first $k$ symbols of the encoded message correspond to the original message;
-2. it is a _linear_ code, i.e., the encoding process is a linear transformation of the input symbols, or in other words, the encoded symbols are
-   linear combinations of the input symbols;
-3. it is _almost optimal_, meaning that the $k' ~ k$. Specifically, the probability of decoding failure for $k' = k + H$ symbols received is
-   $< 1/256^{H+1}$
-
-## RedStuff Encoding
-
-An old idea in distributed storage is to use an erasure code to encode blobs of data across multiple storage nodes. Thus, by using $k/N$ rate erasure
-code, for $N$ nodes and $k$ source symbols, the system can tolerate $N - k$ node failures, with just an $N/k$ factor of storage overhead. However, in
-the case of a node failure, the recovery process is inefficient: the failed node needs to fetch $k$ other parts, reconstruct the blob, and then
-re-encode its own part. Therefore, the communication overhead for recovery is on the order of the size of the whole blob, $S$.
-
-The Twin-Code Framework aims to solve this issue by allowing for efficient node recovery. We briefly describe here how the framework is used in
-RedStuff, and refer to the original paper for the specific details.  The RedStuff encoding algorithm is an adaptation of the Twin-Code framework,
-which allows for efficient node recovery in erasure-coded storage systems.
-
-We consider a scenario in which a blob of data is encoded and stored across $N$ _shards_—multiple shards can be mapped to the same storage node—in a
-Byzantine setting. Thus, we assume that up to $f$ of the shards can be corrupted by an adversary, with $f < 1/3 N$, and that the remaining $N - f$
-shards are honest.
-
-### Encoding and Recovery
-
-The RedStuff encoding and recovery process works as follows:
-
-- First, in RedStuff, the data blob of size $S$ is divided into symbols and arranged in a rectangular _message matrix_, of up to $N - 2f$ rows and
-  $N - f$ columns of symbols. The number of rows ($n_R$) and columns ($n_C$) is fixed, and determines the symbol size $s$ as follows:
-
-$$
-s = \left\lceil \frac{S}{n_R \cdot n_C } \right\rceil
-$$
-
-- Then, the columns and the rows of such message matrix are encoded separately with RaptorQ.
-  - The _primary encoding_, performed on columns, expands the $n_R$ symbols of each column to $N$ symbols (as mentioned above, the rateless nature of
-  RaptorQ allows us to choose the number of encoded symbols).
-  - The _secondary encoding_, performed on rows, expands the $n_C$ symbols of each row to $N$ symbols.
-- Thus, $n_R$ is also called the number of "primary source symbols", and $n_C$ the number of "secondary source symbols". Clearly, the primary encoding
-  has rate $n_R / N$, and the secondary encoding has rate $n_C / N$.
-- The encoded rows and columns are then used to obtain primary and secondary _slivers_, which are distributed to shards and used for blob
-  reconstruction and sliver recovery:
-  - Primary slivers are the rows of the matrix of size $N \times n_C$ obtained with the primary encoding of the message matrix. Each primary sliver is
-    therefore composed of $n_C$ symbols.
-  - Secondary slivers are the columns of the matrix of size $n_R \times N$ obtained with the primary encoding of the message matrix. Each secondary
-    sliver is therefore composed of $n_R$ symbols.
-- Each shard receives a primary and a secondary sliver, based on the shard number and the row and column numbers of the slivers (see the
-  [section on sliver-to-shard mapping](#sliver-pair-to-shard-mapping) for more details).
-- The fundamental property we achieve with this construction, and thanks to the linearity of RaptorQ, is that encoding the primary slivers (as rows)
-  with the secondary encoding and the secondary slivers (as columns) with the primary encoding results in the same $N \times N$ expanded message
-  matrix. This property can then be used for lost sliver recovery:
-  - If a shard is trying reconstruct a lost primary sliver, it can request $N-f$ symbols from the encodings of the secondary slivers of other shards,
-    because, as mentioned above, the primary encoding of secondary slivers results in the symbols for primary slivers. Then, since the secondary
-    encoding has $n_C$ source symbols, and $n_C \leq N-2f$, we can decode the original primary sliver from the obtained recovery symbols with high
-    probability (see the later [discussion on recovery probability](#decoding-probability-and-decoding-safety-limit)).
-  - The reconstruction of secondary slivers is identical, but inverting the role of primary and secondary slivers and encodings.
-
-The following example concretely shows this process in action.
-
-### Worked Example
-
-#### Encoding
-
-Consider a Walrus instance with $N = 7 = 3f + 1$ shards. This entails that the number of primary source symbols is $N - 2f = 3$, and secondary
-$N - f = 5$. A blob of size $S = 15 \cdot s$ can therefore be divided into 15 symbols of size $s$, and arranged in the matrix as follows.
-
-$$
-\left[
-\begin{array}{ccccc}
-s_{0,0} & s_{0,1} & s_{0,2} & s_{0,3} & s_{0,4} \\
-s_{1,0} & s_{1,1} & s_{1,2} & s_{1,3} & s_{1,4} \\
-s_{2,0} & s_{2,1} & s_{2,2} & s_{2,3} & s_{2,4} \\
-\end{array}
-\right]
-$$
-
-Then, the primary encoding acts on the columns of the matrix, expanding them such that each column is composed of 4 source symbols and 6 recovery
-symbols ($s_{i,j}$ indicates source symbols, while $r_{i,j}$ indicates recovery symbols).
-
-$$
-\left[
-\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}
-s_{0,0} & s_{0,1} & s_{0,2} & s_{0,3} & s_{0,4} \\
-s_{1,0} & s_{1,1} & s_{1,2} & s_{1,3} & s_{1,4} \\
-s_{2,0} & s_{2,1} & s_{2,2} & s_{2,3} & s_{2,4} \\
-\textcolor{blue}{r_{3,0}} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{3,1}} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{3,2}} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{3,3}} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{3,4}} \\
-\textcolor{blue}{r_{4,0}} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{4,1}} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{4,2}} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{4,3}} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{4,4}} \\
-\textcolor{blue}{r_{5,0}} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{5,1}} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{5,2}} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{5,3}} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{5,4}} \\
-\textcolor{blue}{r_{6,0}} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{6,1}} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{6,2}} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{6,3}} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{6,4}} \\
-\end{array}
-\right]
-$$
-
-Each of the _rows_ of this column expansion is a _primary sliver_. E.g., $[r_{5,0}, r_{5,1}, r_{5,2}, r_{5,3}, r_{5,4}, r_{5,5}, r_{5,6}]$.
-
-Similarly, the secondary encoding on the rows of the matrix produces the expanded rows.
-
-$$
-\left[
-\begin{array}{ccccccc}
-s_{0,0} & s_{0,1} & s_{0,2} & s_{0,3} & s_{0,4} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{0,5}} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{0,6}} \\
-\hline
-s_{1,0} & s_{1,1} & s_{1,2} & s_{1,3} & s_{1,4} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{1,5}} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{1,6}} \\
-\hline
-s_{2,0} & s_{2,1} & s_{2,2} & s_{2,3} & s_{2,4} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{2,5}} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{2,6}} \\
-\end{array}
-\right]
-$$
-
-Each of the _columns_ of this column expansion is a _secondary sliver_. E.g., $[r_{0,6}, r_{1,6}, r_{2,6}]$.
-
-The $i$ th _sliver pair_ is composed of the $i$ th primary and $i$ th secondary slivers. For simplicity, consider that the $i$ th sliver pair is
-stored on shard $i$ (we later discuss the mapping between sliver pairs and shards).
-
-Thanks to the linearity of RaptorQ, the expansion of
-
-- the recovery secondary slivers (columns 5,6) with the primary encoding; and
-- the recovery primary slivers (rows 3,4,5,6) with the secondary encoding;
-
-result in the same set of symbols, which is essential for recovery. Therefore, these symbols can be represented as the lower-right quadrant of what we
-call the "fully expanded message matrix".
-
-$$
-\left[
-\begin{array}{ccccc|cc}
-% a matrix 7x7 as above, with the lower right 4x2 quadrant in bold
-s_{0,0} & s_{0,1} & s_{0,2} & s_{0,3} & s_{0,4} & r_{0,5} & r_{0,6} \\
-s_{1,0} & s_{1,1} & s_{1,2} & s_{1,3} & s_{1,4} & r_{1,5} & r_{1,6} \\
-s_{2,0} & s_{2,1} & s_{2,2} & s_{2,3} & s_{2,4} & r_{2,5} & r_{2,6} \\
-\hline
-r_{3,0} & r_{3,1} & r_{3,2} & r_{3,3} & r_{3,4} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{3,5}} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{3,6}} \\
-r_{4,0} & r_{4,1} & r_{4,2} & r_{4,3} & r_{4,4} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{4,5}} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{4,6}} \\
-r_{5,0} & r_{5,1} & r_{5,2} & r_{5,3} & r_{5,4} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{5,5}} & \textcolor{blue}{r_{5,6}} \\

-\end{array}
-\right]
-$$
-
-Note again that these symbols do not need to be stored on any node because they can always be recomputed by expanding either a primary or secondary
-symbol. E.g, $r_{4,5}$ can be obtained by:
-
-- the secondary-encoding expansion of the 4th primary sliver: $[r_{4,0}, r_{4,1}, r_{4,2}, r_{4,3}, r_{4,4}, \textcolor{blue}{r_{4,5}}, r_{4,6}]$; or
-- the primary-encoding expansion of the 5th secondary sliver: $[r_{0,5}, r_{1,5}, r_{2,5}, r_{3,5}, \textcolor{blue}{r_{4,5}}, r_{5,5}, r_{6,5}]$.
-
-#### Recovery
-
-Consider now that shard 3 fails, losing its slivers, and needs to recover them.
-In the following, the symbols of the lost slivers are highlighted in red (recall that the lower quadrant is never stored).
-
-$$
-\left[
-\begin{array}{ccccc|cc}
-s_{0,0} & s_{0,1} & s_{0,2} & \textcolor{red}{s_{0,3}} & s_{0,4} & r_{0,5} & r_{0,6} \\
-s_{1,0} & s_{1,1} & s_{1,2} & \textcolor{red}{s_{1,3}} & s_{1,4} & r_{1,5} & r_{1,6} \\
-s_{2,0} & s_{2,1} & s_{2,2} & \textcolor{red}{s_{2,3}} & s_{2,4} & r_{2,5} & r_{2,6} \\
-\hline
-\textcolor{red}{r_{3,0}} & \textcolor{red}{r_{3,1}} & \textcolor{red}{r_{3,2}} & \textcolor{red}{r_{3,3}} & \textcolor{red}{r_{3,4}} & & \\
-r_{4,0} & r_{4,1} & r_{4,2} & r_{4,3} & r_{4,4} & & \\
-r_{5,0} & r_{5,1} & r_{5,2} & r_{5,3} & r_{5,4} & & \\
-r_{6,0} & r_{6,1} & r_{6,2} & r_{6,3} & r_{6,4} & & \\
-\end{array}
-\right]
-$$
-
-To recover the primary sliver, the node needs to contact 5 other shards and request the recovery symbols for the 3rd primary slivers. Since the
-symbols of the sliver are recovery symbols, the shards need to encode their secondary slivers (here highlighted as columns) to obtain them. For
-example, shards 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 provide the symbols:
-
-$$
-\left[
-\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
-s_{0,0} & s_{0,1} & s_{0,2} & \textcolor{red}{s_{0,3}} & s_{0,4} & r_{0,5} & r_{0,6} \\
-s_{1,0} & s_{1,1} & s_{1,2} & \textcolor{red}{s_{1,3}} & s_{1,4} & r_{1,5} & r_{1,6} \\
-s_{2,0} & s_{2,1} & s_{2,2} & \textcolor{red}{s_{2,3}} & s_{2,4} & r_{2,5} & r_{2,6} \\
-\textcolor{green}{r_{3,0}} & \textcolor{green}{r_{3,1}} & \textcolor{green}{r_{3,2}} &  & \textcolor{green}{r_{3,4}} &  & \textcolor{green}{r_{3,6}}\\
-\end{array}
-\right]
-$$
-
-To recover the secondary sliver, the node needs to contact at 3 other shards to obtain recovery symbols. In this case however, the recovery symbols
-are already part of the primary slivers (here highlighted as rows) stored by the other shards, so no re-encoding is necessary. For example, shards 0,
-1, 5 provide the recovery symbols:
-
-$$
-\left[
-\begin{array}{ccccc}
-s_{0,0} & s_{0,1} & s_{0,2} & \textcolor{green}{s_{0,3}} & s_{0,4} \\
-\hline
-s_{1,0} & s_{1,1} & s_{1,2} & \textcolor{green}{s_{1,3}} & s_{1,4} \\
-\hline
-s_{2,0} & s_{2,1} & s_{2,2} & s_{2,3} & s_{2,4} \\
-\hline
-\textcolor{red}{r_{3,0}} & \textcolor{red}{r_{3,1}} & \textcolor{red}{r_{3,2}} & \textcolor{red}{r_{3,3}} & \textcolor{red}{r_{3,4}} \\
-\hline
-r_{4,0} & r_{4,1} & r_{4,2} & r_{4,3} & r_{4,4} \\
-\hline
-r_{5,0} & r_{5,1} & r_{5,2} & \textcolor{green}{r_{5,3}} & r_{5,4} \\
-\hline
-r_{6,0} & r_{6,1} & r_{6,2} & r_{6,3} & r_{6,4} \\
-\end{array}
-\right]
-$$
-
-Note that in this case, the symbols $s_{0,3}, s_{1,3}, s_{2,3}$ are already stored in the primary slivers of shards 0, 1, 2, directly. Therefore, by
-asking these shards, shard 3 does not even need to decode the symbols to recover its secondary sliver.
-
-### Properties and Observations
-
-#### Why the Rectangular Layout?
-
-The rectangular layout of the message matrix is an optimization for the Byzantine setting. When storing the blob, a client can only await $N - f$
-responses, as the remaining $f$ shards can be Byzantine. Yet, $f$ of these $N-f$ may be the Byzantine ones, and the $f$ that did not reply were only
-slow because of asynchrony in the network. Therefore, the blob needs to be encoded in such a way that $N-2f$ symbols are sufficient to recover the
-original blob. This is achieved by the primary encoding.
-
-However, after this initial sharing phase, the honest shards share and reconstruct the missing slivers from each other. At a steady state, therefore,
-we can always assume that $N - f$ honest shards are in possession of their slivers. Thus, the secondary encoding can have a higher rate, $(N-f)/N$,
-decreasing the storage overhead while maintaining the same fault tolerance properties.
-
-#### Worst Case Initial Sharing
-
-We explain here how the $N-f$ honest shards can obtain their sliver pairs in the worst case outlined above, i.e., when the client shares the slivers
-with $N-f$ shards, $f$ of which are Byzantine (and, e.g., drop them).
-
-1. The $N-2f$ honest shards receive the sliver pairs.
-2. The remaining $f$ honest shards are notified of the stored blob (e.g., through the chain), and start the process to recover their sliver pairs.
-3. First, they recover their _secondary slivers_, as they can be decoded from $N-2f$ recovery symbols.
-4. Then, once all $N-f$ honest shards have their secondary slivers, they can start recovering the primary slivers (which indeed require $N-f$ recovery
-   symbols).
-5. All honest shards have their sliver pairs.
-
-#### Storage Overhead
-
-Assume for simplicity that $N=3f+1$. Then, the original blob is divided into roughly $f \cdot 2f = 2f^2$ symbols.
-The system has to store $N \cdot 2f$ primary sliver symbols, and $N \cdot f$ secondary sliver symbols, for a total storage of about $9f^2$ symbols.
-
-Therefore, the storage overhead due to RedStuff encoding is about $9f^2 / 2f^2 = 4.5$ times the original blob size.
-
-#### Differences with the Twin-Code Framework
-
-The key modifications in RedStuff, compared to the original Twin-Code framework, are the following:
-
-- RedStuff uses the RaptorQ fountain code for both the "Type 0" and "Type 1" encoding, as they are called in the paper. The rates are about $(N-2f)/N$
-  and $(N-f)/N$ respectively. We later discuss more in detail the exact rates and the decoding probability. We call the Type 0 encoding the _primary
-  encoding_, and the Type 1 encoding the _secondary encoding_.
-- The blob is not laid out in a square message matrix, but in a rectangular one. As we explain in the following, this is an optimization for the
-  specific BFT setting we are considering.
-- Both "Type 0" and "Type 1" encodings are stored on each shard. In our terminology these are called "slivers", and the two together form a "sliver
-  pair".
-
-## Walrus-specific Parameters and Considerations
-
-### Sliver-Pair-to-Shard Mapping
-
-So far we have assumed that sliver pair $i$ is stored on shard $i$. In practice, however, the sliver pairs are mapped to shards in a pseudo-random
-fashion. This is to ensure that the _systematic_ slivers, i.e., the slivers that contain the original data, are not always stored on the same
-shard.
-
-This is important because we foresee that the systematic slivers will be the most frequently accessed, because they can be used to access the data
-without any decoding.
-
-In brief, the mapping is done as follows: each encoded blob is assigned a 32 byte pseudo random blob ID. This ID is interpreted as an unsigned
-big-endian integer, and its reminder modulo $N$ is then used as a rotation offset, such that the sliver pair $i$ is stored on shard
-$(i + \text{offset}) \mod N$.
-
-### Decoding Probability and Decoding Safety Limit
-
-As mentioned above, the reconstruction failure probability of the RaptorQ code is $O(256^{-(H+1)})$, where $H$ is the number of extra symbols
-received.  Therefore, it is beneficial that in a system with $f$ Byzantine shards, the number of source symbols for the primary encoding is slightly
-below $N-2f$, and for the secondary encoding slightly below $N-f$. This ensures that whenever a validity or quorum threshold of messages is received,
-there is always a positive $H$ for a low failure probability.
-
-We therefore set the following parameters in our encoding configuration:
-
-- $f$, the maximum number of Byzantine shards is $\lfloor (N-1) / 3 \rfloor$.
-- The _safety limit_ for the encoding, $\sigma$, to ensure high reconstruction probability, is set as a function of $N$ (see table below).
-- The number of primary source symbols (equivalent to the number of symbols in a secondary sliver) is $N - 2f -\sigma$
-- The number of secondary source symbols (equivalent to the number of symbols in a primary sliver) is $N - f -\sigma$
-
-Currently, $\sigma$ is selected depending on the number of shards as follows:
-
-| N shards from | N shards to (incl) | $\sigma$ | Prob. failure |
-|--------------:|-------------------:|---------:|--------------:|
-|             0 |                 15 |        0 |       0.00391 |
-|            16 |                 30 |        1 |      1.53e-05 |
-|            31 |                 45 |        2 |      5.96e-08 |
-|            46 |                 60 |        3 |      2.33e-10 |
-|            61 |                 75 |        4 |      9.09e-13 |
-|            76 |                inf |        5 |      3.55e-15 |
-
-For example, then, we have the following settings:
-
-| N shards |   f | $\sigma$ | # primary | # secondary |
-|---------:|----:|---------:|----------:|------------:|
-|        7 |   2 |        0 |         3 |           5 |
-|       10 |   3 |        0 |         4 |           7 |
-|       31 |  10 |        2 |         9 |          19 |
-|      100 |  33 |        5 |        29 |          62 |
-|      300 |  99 |        5 |        97 |         196 |
-|     1000 | 333 |        5 |       329 |         662 |
-
-## Blob Size Limits
-
-In RaptorQ, the size of a symbol is encoded as a 16-bit integer. Therefore, the maximum size of a blob that can be encoded is $2^{16} - 1 = 65535$
-bytes. As a minimum, a symbol must be at least 1 byte.
-
-Since the blob is encoded in the rectangular message matrix, the blob size is upperbound by `source_symbols_primary * source_symbols_secondary *
-u16::MAX` and lowerbound by `source_symbols_primary * source_symbols_secondary`. A few examples for the same configurations as above:
-
-| N shards | Min blob size | Max blob size | Min encoded blob size | Max encoded blob size |
-|---------:|--------------:|--------------:|----------------------:|----------------------:|
-|        7 |        15.0 B |        983 KB |                56.0 B |               3.67 MB |
-|       10 |        28.0 B |       1.83 MB |                 110 B |               7.21 MB |
-|       31 |         171 B |       11.2 MB |                 868 B |               56.9 MB |

-|      300 |       19.0 KB |       1.25 GB |               87.9 KB |               5.76 GB |
-|     1000 |        218 KB |       14.3 GB |                991 KB |               64.9 GB |
-
-## Sliver Authentication, Blob Metadata, and the Blob ID
-
-Alongside the efficient encoding performed by RedStuff, we want to enable shards to authenticate that the slivers and encoding symbols they receive
-indeed belong to the blob they wanted. We briefly outline here how this is achieved.
-
-For each sliver, primary or secondary, a Merkle tree is constructed.
-
-![](./assets/sliver-hash.png)
-
-Importantly, the tree is constructed over all the $N$ symbols of the _fully expanded sliver_.  The root node of the Merkle tree (the sliver hash) is
-included in the metadata for the blob. Therefore, to prove that a symbol is part of a sliver, the prover supplies the symbol alongside the Merkle path
-to the root hash, which every node has as part of the metadata.
-
-Then, a Merkle tree over the sliver hashes is computed to obtain a blob hash. This is computed by concatenating primary and secondary sliver hashes
-(computed as above) for each sliver pair, and then constructing the Merle tree over the concatenations ($c_i$ in the figure). This construction was
-chosen to reduce the number of hashing operations compared to hashing each sliver Merkle root individually.
-
-![](./assets/blob-hash.png)
-
-Therefore, to prove that a sliver is indeed part of a blob, it is sufficient to provide the Merkle path to the root.
-
-Finally, the encoding type tag (representing the RedStuff version, or alternative encoding), the length of the blob _before_ the encoding, and the
-Merkle root of the tree over the slivers are hashed together to obtain the _blob ID_.
-
-### Metadata Overhead
-
-As seen above, each storage node needs to store the full metadata for the blob.
-The metadata consists of:
-
-- A `32 B` Merkle root hash for each primary and secondary sliver;
-- the `32 B` blob ID, computed as above;
-- the erasure code type (`1 B`);
-- the length of the unencoded blob size (`8 B`).
-
-Of these, the hashes for the primary and secondary slivers can be a considerable overhead, if the number of shards is high. We show here the
-cumulative size of the hashes stored on the system, depending on the number of nodes and the number of shards.
-
-| N shards | One node | floor(N/floor(log2(N)) nodes | N nodes |
-|---------:|---------:|-----------------------------:|--------:|
-|        7 |    448 B |                      1.34 KB | 3.14 KB |
-|       10 |    640 B |                      1.92 KB | 6.40 KB |
-|       31 |  1.98 KB |                      13.9 KB | 61.5 KB |
-|      100 |  6.40 KB |                       102 KB |  640 KB |
-|      300 |  19.2 KB |                       710 KB | 5.76 MB |
-|     1000 |  64.0 KB |                      7.10 MB | 64.0 MB |
-
-We see that the cumulative size of the hashes in the case of 1000 nodes (1 node per shard), is 64KB per node, or 64MB for a system of 1000 nodes.
-However, recall that the number of shards is set and constant, while the number of nodes may vary (each node has one or more shards), potentially
-lowering the overhead on the system.  We therefore show here the ratio between the size of the hashes stored on the system to the minimum and maximum
-blob sizes, for `N=1000` shards and different number of nodes (1 node, floor(N/floor(log2(N))) = 111, 1000).
-
-| N = 1000                      | Total metadata size | Factor min blob | Factor max blob | Factor min encoded blob | Factor max encoded blob |
-| ----------------------------- | ------------------: | --------------: | --------------: | ----------------------: | ----------------------: |
-| Single node                   |             64.0 KB |           0.294 |        4.48e-06 |                  0.0646 |                9.85e-07 |
-| floor(N/floor(log2(N))) nodes |             7.10 MB |            32.6 |        0.000498 |                    7.17 |                0.000109 |
-| N nodes                       |             64.0 MB |             294 |         0.00448 |                    64.6 |                0.000985 |
-
-We see that for realistic node counts and small blob sizes, the total metadata overhead goes can be multiple times the size of the initial unencoded
-blob. However, for larger blob sizes, the overhead is negligible.

+# Website
+
+This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.
+
+## Installation
+
+```bash
+yarn
+```
+
+## Local Development
+
+```bash
+yarn start
+```
+
+This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
+
+## Build
+
+```bash
+yarn build
+```
+
+This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
+
+## Deployment
+
+Using SSH:
+
+```bash
+USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
+```
+
+Not using SSH:
+
+```bash
+GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
+```
+
+If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.

+
+Walrus is a decentralized storage and data availability protocol designed specifically for large
+binary files, or blobs. Walrus focuses on providing a robust but affordable solution for storing
+unstructured content on decentralized storage nodes while ensuring high availability and
+reliability even in the presence of Byzantine faults.
+
+:::tip Fun fact
+
+If you are viewing this site at https://docs.wal.app, you are fetching this from
+Walrus behind the scenes. See the [Walrus Sites chapter](/docs/walrus-sites/intro) for further
+details on how this works.
+
+:::
+
+## Features
+
+- **Storage and retrieval:** Walrus supports storage operations to write and read blobs. It also
+  allows anyone to prove that a blob has been stored and is available for retrieval at a later
+  time.
+
+- **Cost efficiency:** By utilizing advanced erasure coding, Walrus maintains storage costs at
+  approximately five times the size of the stored blobs, and encoded parts of each blob are stored
+  on each storage node. This is significantly more cost-effective than traditional full-replication
+  methods and much more robust against failures than protocols that only store each blob on a subset
+  of storage nodes.
+
+- **Integration with the Sui blockchain:** Walrus leverages [Sui](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui)
+  for coordination, attesting availability, and payments. Storage space is represented as a resource
+  on Sui, which can be owned, split, merged, and transferred. Stored blobs are also represented by
+  objects on Sui, which means that smart contracts can check whether a blob is available and for how
+  long, extend its lifetime or optionally delete it.
+
+- **Epochs, tokenomics, and delegated proof of stake** Walrus is operated by a committee of storage
+  nodes that evolve between epochs. A native token, WAL (and its subdivision FROST, where 1 WAL is
+  equal to 1 billion FROST), is used to delegate stake to storage nodes, and those with high stake
+  become part of the epoch committee. The WAL token is also used for payments for storage. At the
+  end of each epoch, rewards for selecting storage nodes, storing and serving blobs are distributed
+  to storage nodes and whose that stake with them. All these processes are mediated by smart
+  contracts on the Sui platform.
+
+- **Flexible access:** Users can interact with Walrus through a command-line interface (CLI),
+  software development kits (SDKs), and web2 HTTP technologies. Walrus is designed to work well
+  with traditional caches and content distribution networks (CDNs), while ensuring all operations
+  can also be run using local tools to maximize decentralization.
+
+:::danger Public access
+
+**All blobs stored in Walrus are public and discoverable by all.** Therefore you must not use Walrus
+to store anything that contains secrets or private data without additional measures to protect
+confidentiality. Refer to [Data Security](/docs/dev-guide/data-security) for such use cases.
+
+:::
+
+## Architecture and operations
+
+Walrus's architecture ensures that content remains accessible and retrievable even when many
+storage nodes are unavailable or malicious. Under the hood it uses modern error correction
+techniques based on fast linear fountain codes, augmented to ensure resilience against Byzantine
+faults, and a dynamically changing set of storage nodes. The core of Walrus remains simple, and
+storage node management and blob certification leverages Sui smart contracts.
+
+## Organization
+
+This documentation is split into several parts:
+
+1. _Docs_ provides concrete information on Walrus for developers. If you want to get started quickly, you can
+   jump directly to [Getting Started with Walrus](/docs/usage/started).
+1. _Walrus Sites_ describes how you can use Walrus and Sui together to build truly decentralized
+   websites.
+1. _Design_ describes the objectives, security properties, and architecture of Walrus.
+1. _Dev blog_ contains announcements and other blog posts.

commit 165b05123d5403306e1cad3765b2149727ebe932
Author: Markus Legner <mlegner@users.noreply.github.com>
Date:   Mon Dec 8 10:40:30 2025 +0100

    fix(node): delete per-object blob info when blob is deleted (#2746)
    
    Also contains some test improvements:
    * Improve the blob-info internal consistency check and fail in tests if
      the consistency check fails.
    * Improve logging and error outputs in tests.

commit 7fa81293338df77ea7e6f670b5f7674823fc97dc
Author: Markus Legner <mlegner@users.noreply.github.com>
Date:   Fri Dec 5 12:16:18 2025 +0100

    fix(node): avoid errors when storing metadata for untracked blobs (#2747)
    
    There is an extremely unlikely race condition when storing the blob
    metadata where a blob-info entry is deleted between checking it in the
    `StorageNodeInner::store_metadata` method and actually persisting the
    metadata in the `Storage::put_metadata` method. This can result in a
    `BlobInfoMergeOperand::MarkMetadataStored` merge operand being applied
    to an untracked blob ID, which would previously result in a panic.
    
    With this change, we allow the merge operation to proceed. The resulting
    blob info will then be removed during the next garbage collection.
    
    This commit also adds a new simtest where we repeatedly store and delete
    blobs with a relatively short epoch duration.
